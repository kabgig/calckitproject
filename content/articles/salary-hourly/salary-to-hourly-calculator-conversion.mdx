## Basic Conversion Formula

### Salary to Hourly

**Standard Formula:**
```
Hourly Rate = Annual Salary / Annual Work Hours
```

**Most Common Calculation:**
```
Hourly Rate = Annual Salary / 2,080 hours
```

2,080 hours = 40 hours/week × 52 weeks/year

**Example:**
- Annual salary: $60,000
- Hourly rate: $60,000 / 2,080 = **$28.85/hour**

### Hourly to Salary

**Standard Formula:**
```
Annual Salary = Hourly Rate × Annual Work Hours
```

**Most Common Calculation:**
```
Annual Salary = Hourly Rate × 2,080 hours
```

**Example:**
- Hourly rate: $35/hour
- Annual salary: $35 × 2,080 = **$72,800/year**

### Quick Mental Math

**Salary to Hourly (approximate):**
Divide annual salary by 2,000

- $50,000 / 2,000 = **$25/hour**
- $80,000 / 2,000 = **$40/hour**
- $100,000 / 2,000 = **$50/hour**

This gives a slightly higher hourly rate but is easy to calculate quickly.

**Hourly to Salary (approximate):**
Multiply hourly rate by 2,000

- $20/hour × 2,000 = **$40,000/year**
- $30/hour × 2,000 = **$60,000/year**
- $45/hour × 2,000 = **$90,000/year**

## Standard Work Hours Explained

### The 2,080 Hour Standard

**Calculation:**
- 40 hours/week × 52 weeks/year = 2,080 hours

This assumes:
- ✓ Full-time employment (40 hours/week)
- ✓ 52 weeks per year
- ✓ No unpaid time off
- ✓ No overtime

**Reality:**
Most people don't actually work 2,080 hours per year after accounting for:
- Paid vacation
- Sick days
- Holidays
- Personal days

### Adjusted Work Hours

**With Typical Benefits:**

**Starting calculation:**
52 weeks × 40 hours = 2,080 hours

**Subtract:**
- 10 vacation days: -80 hours
- 5 sick days: -40 hours
- 10 federal holidays: -80 hours
**Actual working hours: 1,880**

**Impact on Hourly Rate:**

$60,000 salary:
- Standard calculation: $60,000 / 2,080 = $28.85/hour
- Actual working hours: $60,000 / 1,880 = **$31.91/hour**
- **Effective rate is 10.6% higher!**

### Weekly and Biweekly Conversions

**From Annual Salary to Weekly:**
```
Weekly Pay = Annual Salary / 52 weeks
```

Example: $60,000 / 52 = $1,154/week

**From Annual Salary to Biweekly (every 2 weeks):**
```
Biweekly Pay = Annual Salary / 26 pay periods
```

Example: $60,000 / 26 = $2,308 biweekly

**From Hourly to Weekly:**
```
Weekly Pay = Hourly Rate × 40 hours
```

Example: $25/hour × 40 = $1,000/week

**From Hourly to Biweekly:**
```
Biweekly Pay = Hourly Rate × 80 hours
```

Example: $25/hour × 80 = $2,000 biweekly

## True Hourly Rate Calculation

Your true hourly rate accounts for actual hours worked, including unpaid overtime and work-related time.

### Method 1: Including Unpaid Overtime

Many salaried employees work more than 40 hours/week without additional pay.

**Formula:**
```
True Hourly Rate = Annual Salary / (Weekly Hours × 52 weeks)
```

**Example:**

Salary: $75,000
Actual weekly hours: 50 (includes regular overtime)

True hourly rate = $75,000 / (50 × 52) = $75,000 / 2,600 = **$28.85/hour**

**Compare to standard:**
- If calculated at 40 hours: $75,000 / 2,080 = $36.06/hour
- Actual rate (50 hours): $28.85/hour
- **You're effectively working for 20% less per hour**

### Method 2: Including Commute and Prep Time

**Total Time Investment:**
- Work hours: 40/week
- Commute: 5 hours/week
- Work prep (getting ready): 2.5 hours/week
- **Total: 47.5 hours/week**

**Calculation:**

Salary: $60,000
Total time: 47.5 hours × 52 weeks = 2,470 hours

True hourly rate = $60,000 / 2,470 = **$24.29/hour**

**Compare to stated:**
- Stated rate: $28.85/hour
- True rate with time investment: $24.29/hour
- **15.8% lower when including all time**

### Method 3: Net Hourly Rate (After Taxes)

Your take-home pay is what actually matters.

**Formula:**
```
Net Hourly Rate = (Annual Salary - Taxes) / Hours Worked
```

**Example:**

- Annual salary: $80,000
- Federal tax: $12,000
- State tax: $4,000
- FICA (7.65%): $6,120
- **Take-home: $57,880**

Net hourly rate = $57,880 / 2,080 = **$27.83/hour**

**Compare to gross:**
- Gross hourly: $38.46/hour
- Net hourly: $27.83/hour
- **Actual purchasing power: 27.6% less**

## Comparing Salaried vs. Hourly

- Typical hours: 45/week

**Offer B: Hourly**
- Rate: $35/hour
- Limited benefits: $2,000 value
- No PTO
- Typical hours: 40/week
- Overtime available

**Analysis:**

**Offer A:**
- Base: $70,000
- Benefits: $8,000
- **Total value: $78,000**
- Hours: 45/week × 52 = 2,340 hours
- True hourly: $78,000 / 2,340 = **$33.33/hour**

**Offer B:**
- Rate: $35/hour
- Hours: 40/week × 52 = 2,080 hours
- Base pay: $35 × 2,080 = $72,800
- Benefits: $2,000
- **Total value: $74,800**
- True hourly: **$35.96/hour** (if including benefits)

**Conclusion:**
Offer B has higher true hourly rate, but Offer A may be better for work-life balance and stability.

**Total compensation: $98,350**

True hourly rate:
- Working hours: 1,880 (after PTO/holidays)
- $98,350 / 1,880 = **$52.31/hour**

**Compare to stated:**
- Stated: $75,000 / 2,080 = $36.06/hour
- True comp: $52.31/hour
- **Benefits add 45% to hourly value!**

## Part-Time and Overtime

### Part-Time Calculations

**30 Hours per Week:**
- Annual hours: 30 × 52 = 1,560 hours
- $25/hour × 1,560 = **$39,000/year**

**20 Hours per Week:**
- Annual hours: 20 × 52 = 1,040 hours
- $25/hour × 1,040 = **$26,000/year**

**Variable Hours:**
Average your weekly hours over 12 weeks, then multiply.

### Overtime Calculations

Hourly workers typically earn 1.5x their rate for hours over 40/week.

**Example:**

- Regular rate: $20/hour
- Overtime rate: $20 × 1.5 = $30/hour

**Week with Overtime:**
- Regular hours: 40 × $20 = $800
- Overtime hours: 10 × $30 = $300
- **Total week: $1,100**

**Annual with Regular Overtime:**
- 45 hours/week average
- Regular: 40 × $20 × 52 = $41,600
- Overtime: 5 × $30 × 52 = $7,800
- **Annual total: $49,400**

**Effective Annual Rate:**
$49,400 / (45 × 52) = **$21.11/hour**
(Higher than base rate due to overtime premium)

### Salaried Exempt vs. Non-Exempt

**Exempt (No Overtime):**
- Must earn at least $684/week ($35,568/year) as of 2024
- Professional, executive, or administrative role
- Not eligible for overtime

**Non-Exempt ( Eligible for Overtime):**
- Must be paid for all hours over 40/week
- Overtime rate: 1.5x regular rate
- Can be salaried or hourly

**Salaried Non-Exempt Example:**

- Salary: $50,000/year
- Implied hourly: $50,000 / 2,080 = $24.04/hour
- Overtime rate: $24.04 × 1.5 = $36.06/hour

Works 50 hours one week:
- Regular 40 hours: Covered by salary
- 10 overtime hours: 10 × $36.06 = $360.60 extra

## Real Conversion Examples

### Example 1: Comparing Two Job Offers

**Job A:**
- Title: Software Engineer
- Salary: $95,000
- Benefits: Full (value $18,000)
- Expected hours: 45/week
- Flexible remote work

**Job B:**
- Title: Software Developer
- Salary: $87,000
- Benefits: Good (value $12,000)
- Expected hours: 40/week
- Office-based (1 hour daily commute)

**Analysis:**

**Job A:**
- Total comp: $95,000 + $18,000 = $113,000
- Hours with prep/commute: 45 + 3 = 48/week
- Annual hours: 48 × 52 = 2,496
- True hourly: $113,000 / 2,496 = **$45.27/hour**

**Job B:**
- Total comp: $87,000 + $12,000 = $99,000
- Hours with commute: 40 + 10 = 50/week
- Annual hours: 50 × 52 = 2,600
- True hourly: $99,000 / 2,600 = **$38.08/hour**

**Winner: Job A**
- $7.19/hour higher true rate
- Better work-life balance
- Higher total value

### Example 2: Evaluating a Raise

**Current:**
- Salary: $65,000
- $31.25/hour (at 2,080 hours)

**New Offer:**
- Salary: $70,000
- $33.65/hour (at 2,080 hours)

**Raise:**
- Dollar amount: $5,000
- Percentage: 7.7%
- Hourly increase: $2.40/hour

**But with increased responsibility:**
- New expected hours: 50/week
- True hourly: $70,000 / 2,600 = $26.92/hour
- **Effective pay cut:** From $31.25 to $26.92/hour

**Negotiation point:**
To maintain hourly rate at 50 hours/week:
$31.25 × 2,600 hours = **$81,250 needed**

### Example 3: Freelancer Rate Setting

**Goal annual income:** $75,000

**Available work hours:**
- 50 weeks/year (2 weeks off)
- 30 billable hours/week
- Total: 1,500 billable hours

**Minimum hourly rate:**
$75,000 / 1,500 = **$50/hour minimum**

**But account for:**
- Self-employment tax (7.65% extra): +$5,738
- Health insurance: +$8,000
- No paid time off factor
- Business expenses: +$5,000
- **Actual need: $93,738**

**Adjusted rate:**
$93,738 / 1,500 = **$62.49/hour minimum**

**Round to:** $65-70/hour for comfortable margin

### Example 4: Salary Negotiation

**Offer:** $80,000 salary

**Your calculation:**
- Expected hours: 50/week (based on company culture)
- True rate: $80,000 / 2,600 = $30.77/hour

**Your target:** $40/hour true rate

**Counter-offer calculation:**
$40/hour × 2,600 hours = **$104,000**

Or negotiate:
- $95,000 salary with strict 40-hour expectations
- $95,000 / 2,080 = $45.67/hour
- Better work-life balance
