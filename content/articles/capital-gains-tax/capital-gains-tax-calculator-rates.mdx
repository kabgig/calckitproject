# Capital Gains Tax Calculator: Long-Term vs Short-Term Rates 2026

Capital gains taxes can consume 15-40% of your investment profits if you're not strategic—yet most investors trigger unnecessary tax bills by selling at the wrong time, failing to use tax-loss harvesting, or misunderstanding cost basis rules. Someone in the 24% bracket selling stocks held 11 months pays 24% tax, while waiting one more month drops the tax to 15%—saving $900 on a $10,000 gain. High earners in California can face combined federal and state capital gains taxes exceeding 37%.

This comprehensive guide covers long-term vs short-term capital gains rates, calculating your tax liability, cost basis methods, the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), state capital gains taxes, tax-loss harvesting strategies, and advanced techniques to minimize capital gains taxes legally.

## Long-Term vs Short-Term Capital Gains

### The Critical 12-Month Rule

**Holding period determines everything:**

**Short-term:** Held 12 months or less
- Taxed as ordinary income
- Rates: 10-37% (your income tax bracket)
- No special treatment

**Long-term:** Held more than 12 months
- Preferential tax rates
- Rates: 0%, 15%, or 20%
- Significantly lower taxes

**Example: $10,000 capital gain**

**Held 11 months (short-term):**
- Tax at 24% bracket: $2,400

**Held 13 months (long-term):**
- Tax at 15% rate: $1,500

**One month difference saves $900 (37.5% tax reduction)!**

### Calculating Holding Period

**Day you buy: Doesn't count**
**Day you sell: Counts**

**Example: Buying stock**
- Bought: March 15, 2025
- Sell: March 15, 2026 → Short-term (exactly 12 months, not MORE than)
- Sell: March 16, 2026 → Long-term (12 months + 1 day)

**Always hold at least one year and one day** for long-term treatment.

### How the IRS Sees It

**Stock purchase date: Trade date, not settlement date**

**Trade date:** When you clicked "buy"
**Settlement date:** 2 business days later (when money moves)

**Use trade date for holding period calculation.**

**Example:**
- Bought: Feb 12, 2025 (trade date), settled Feb 16
- Sell: Feb 13, 2026 (trade date)
- Holding period: Feb 12, 2025 → Feb 13, 2026 = Long-term ✓

### Special Rules for Different Assets

**Stocks/bonds:** Clear long-term after 12 months

**Real estate:**
- Primary residence: Special $250K/$500K exclusion (see below)
- Investment property: Long-term after 12 months
- Depreciation recapture: Taxed at 25% (separate from capital gain)

**Mutual funds:**
- Holding period starts day after purchase
- Even if fund holds stocks long-term, YOUR holding period is what matters

**Inherited assets:**
- Always treated as long-term (regardless of how long you held)
- Step-up in basis (cost basis = value at death)

**Gifts:**
- Inherit donor's holding period
- Receive stock as gift? Donor's purchase date carries over

## 2026 Capital Gains Tax Rates

### Long-Term Capital Gains Rates

**Federal rates (2026):**

| Filing Status | 0% Rate | 15% Rate | 20% Rate |
|---------------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Single** | Up to $47,000 | $47,001-$518,000 | Over $518,000 |
| **Married Filing Jointly** | Up to $94,000 | $94,001-$583,000 | Over $583,000 |
| **Married Filing Separately** | Up to $47,000 | $47,001-$291,500 | Over $291,500 |
| **Head of Household** | Up to $63,000 | $63,001-$551,000 | Over $551,000 |

**Based on taxable income, not just capital gains.**

### Short-Term Capital Gains Rates

**Same as ordinary income tax brackets:**

| Filing Status | 10% | 12% | 22% | 24% | 32% | 35% | 37% |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Single** | $0-11,600 | $11,601-47,150 | $47,151-100,525 | $100,526-191,950 | $191,951-243,725 | $243,726-609,350 | Over $609,350 |
| **Married Joint** | $0-23,200 | $23,201-94,300 | $94,301-201,050 | $201,051-383,900 | $383,901-487,450 | $487,451-731,200 | Over $731,200 |

**Short-term gains taxed harshly—up to 37% federal!**

### Example: Same Gain, Different Rates

**Single filer, $80,000 salary, $20,000 capital gain**

**Scenario A: Short-term (held 6 months)**
- Total income: $100,000
- Short-term gain taxed at 24%
- **Tax on gain: $4,800**

**Scenario B: Long-term (held 18 months)**
- Total income: $100,000 (for bracket determination)
- Long-term gain taxed at 15%
- **Tax on gain: $3,000**

**Waiting 12 months saves $1,800 (37.5% less tax)!**

### The 0% Long-Term Rate Sweet Spot

**Income under $47,000 (single) or $94,000 (married)?**

**Pay ZERO long-term capital gains tax!**

**Example: Retiree**
- Retirement income: $50,000 (pension/SS)
- Long-term capital gains: $40,000 (stock sales)
- Total: $90,000
- Married filing jointly

**Analysis:**
- First $94,000 taxed at 0% for LT gains
- But total income is $90,000
- **Capital gains tax: $0!**

**Strategic: Realize gains in low-income years** (early retirement, sabbatical, between jobs)

### The 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax

**Above certain thresholds, pay extra 3.8%:**

| Filing Status | NIIT Threshold |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Single** | $200,000 |
| **Married Joint** | $250,000 |
| **Married Separate** | $125,000|

**Applies to LESSER of:**
- Net investment income (capital gains, dividends, interest) OR
- MAGI over threshold

**Example: Single, $220,000 income (all wages), $15,000 LT capital gains**
- Total: $235,000
- Over $200K by: $35,000
- NIIT applies to: LESSER of $15,000 (investment income) or $35,000 (excess)
- NIIT on $15,000 at 3.8% = **$570 extra**

**Total federal tax on $15,000 LT gain:**
- Regular LT cap gains: $2,250 (15%)
- NIIT: $570 (3.8%)
- **Total: $2,820 (18.8% effective rate)**

**High earners face nearly 20% federal rate on long-term gains!**

## Calculating Your Capital Gains Tax

### Basic Capital Gains Formula

```
Capital Gain = Selling Price - Cost Basis - Selling Costs
```

**Example: Stock sale**
- Bought: $10,000
- Sold: $18,000
- Commission: $100
- Capital gain: $18,000 - $10,000 - $100 = **$7,900**

### What is Cost Basis?

**Cost basis = What you paid + associated costs**

**Includes:**
- Purchase price
- Commissions/fees to buy
- Reinvested dividends (mutual funds)
- Stock splits (adjusted)

**Stock example:**
- Bought 100 shares at $50 = $5,000
- Commission: $50
- **Cost basis: $5,050** (not $5,000)

**Mutual fund:**
- Initial purchase: $10,000
- Reinvested dividends over 5 years: $1,500 (you paid tax on these already!)
- **Cost basis: $11,500** (not $10,000)

**Missing dividend reinvestment = paying tax twice!**

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Sale of 200 shares:**

**Step 1: Determine proceeds**
- Sale price: $120/share × 200 = $24,000
- Commission: $100
- Net proceeds: $23,900

**Step 2: Calculate cost basis**
- Purchase price: $80/share × 200 = $16,000
- Commission when buying: $50
- Total basis: $16,050

**Step 3: Capital gain**
$23,900 - $16,050 = **$7,850**

**Step 4: Holding period**
- Bought: Jan 10, 2023
- Sold: Feb 15, 2026
- Duration: 3+ years → **Long-term**

**Step 5: Tax**
- Assume 15% LT bracket
- Tax: $7,850 × 15% = **$1,177.50**

### Adjustments to Cost Basis

**Stock splits:**
- Bought 100 shares at $100 = $10,000
- Stock splits 2-for-1
- Now own 200 shares
- **Basis per share: $50** (not $100)

**Spin-offs:**
- Own Parent Co stock, basis $10,000
- Company spins off division
- Receive SpinCo shares (20% of parent value)
- Parent basis: $8,000
- SpinCo basis: $2,000

**Wash sale:**
- Sell stock at $1,000 loss
- Buy substantially identical stock within 30 days
- **Loss disallowed, added to basis of new purchase**

## Cost Basis Methods

### FIFO (First In, First Out)

**Default method: Sell oldest shares first**

**Example: Three purchases**
- Jan 2024: 100 shares at $50 = $5,000
- June 2024: 100 shares at $60 = $6,000
- Dec 2024: 100 shares at $70 = $7,000

**Sell 150 shares in Feb 2026 at $80:**

**FIFO assumption:**
- First 100 from Jan 2024 ($50 basis)
- Next 50 from June 2024 ($60 basis)

**Gain:**
- 100 × ($80-$50) = $3,000
- 50 × ($80-$60) = $1,000
- **Total: $4,000**

### Specific Identification

**You choose which shares to sell (must designate BEFORE sale)**

**Same example, but you specify:**

**"Sell 100 from Dec 2024 and 50 from June 2024"**

**Gain:**
- 100 × ($80-$70) = $1,000
- 50 × ($80-$60) = $1,000
- **Total: $2,000**

**Half the gain of FIFO!** (Save $2,000 × 15% = $300 tax)

**HOW TO:**
- Tell broker BEFORE sale: "Sell tax lot from 12/15/2024"
- Get written confirmation
- Without designation, FIFO applies

### Average Cost (Mutual Funds Only)

**Mutual funds: Can use average cost**

**Purchases:**
- Jan 2023: $5,000 (100 shares at $50)
- Jan 2024: $6,000 (100 shares at $60)
- Jan 2025: $7,000 (100 shares at $70)
- **Total: 300 shares, $18,000 invested**

**Average cost:** $18,000 / 300 = $60/share

**Sell 150 shares at $80:**
- Gain: 150 × ($80-$60) = **$3,000**

**Simpler than FIFO, no need to track lots**

**Once chosen, must continue** for that fund (can't switch back to FIFO)

### Highest Cost (Tax Optimization)

**Strategic: Sell highest-cost shares to minimize gain**

**Portfolio at a peak, need cash, want to minimize taxes:**

**Use specific identification to sell highest cost basis shares**

**Goal: Take small gain now, save low-basis shares for future** (maybe in low-income year when you can use 0% rate)

### Reinvested Dividends Trap

**Critical: Track reinvested dividends!**

**Mutual fund over 10 years:**
- Initial purchase: $50,000
- Reinvested dividends: $15,000 (taxed each year as received)
- Total basis: $65,000

**Sell for $90,000:**

**If you forget dividends:**
- Gain: $90,000 - $50,000 = $40,000
- Tax at 15%: $6,000

**Correctly:**
- Gain: $90,000 - $65,000 = $25,000
- Tax at 15%: $3,750

**Forgetting costs $2,250 extra!** (60% more tax)

**Brokerage should track this, but VERIFY**

## Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)

### What is NIIT?

**Additional 3.8% tax on investment income for high earners**

**Enacted: 2013 (Affordable Care Act)**

**Applies to:**
- Capital gains
- Dividends
- Interest
- Rental income (passive)
- Annuities

**NOT subject to NIIT:**
- Wages
- Self-employment income (active)
- Social Security
- Tax-exempt interest

### NIIT Income Thresholds

**3.8% tax applies if MAGI exceeds:**

| Filing Status | Threshold |
|---------------|-----------|
| Single | $200,000 |
| Married Joint | $250,000 |
| Married Separate | $125,000 |
| Head of Household | $200,000 |

**No phaseout—it's a cliff**

$199,000 income: No NIIT
$201,000 income: NIIT applies

### Calculating NIIT

**NIIT = 3.8% × LESSER of:**
1. Net investment income OR
2. MAGI - Threshold

**Example 1: Single, $240,000 wages, $30,000 LT capital gains**
- MAGI: $270,000
- Net investment income: $30,000
- Excess over $200K: $70,000
- NIIT on LESSER: min($30K, $70K) = $30,000
- **NIIT: $30,000 × 3.8% = $1,140**

**Example 2: Single, $180,000 wages, $30,000 capital gains**
- MAGI: $210,000
- Net investment income: $30,000
- Excess over $200K: $10,000
- NIIT on LESSER: min($30K, $10K) = $10,000
- **NIIT: $10,000 × 3.8% = $380**

**Only $10K of $30K gains subject to NIIT**

**Example 3: Single, $195,000 wages, $30,000 capital gains**
- MAGI: $225,000
- Excess over $200K: $25,000
- NIIT on: $25,000
- **NIIT: $25,000 × 3.8% = $950**

### Total Tax Including NIIT

**Single filer, $220,000 income, $50,000 LT capital gain**

**Federal income tax:**
- Long-term cap gains: $50,000 × 15% = $7,500

**NIIT:**
- Excess MAGI: $270,000 - $200,000 = $70,000
- Investment income: $50,000
- NIIT on: min($50K, $70K) = $50,000
- NIIT: $50,000 × 3.8% = $1,900

**Total federal:**
$7,500 + $1,900 = **$9,400** (18.8% effective rate)

**Long-term gains aren't 15% for high earners—they're 18.8%!**

### Strategies to Avoid NIIT

**Stay under threshold:**
- Max 401k contributions (reduce MAGI)
- HSA contributions (reduce MAGI)
- Traditional IRA (if eligible)

**Time gains strategically:**
- Spread over multiple years
- Realize in low-income years

**Use tax-advantaged accounts:**
- Roth accounts (no MAGI impact on withdrawals)
- Municipal bonds (interest exempt)

## State Capital Gains Taxes

### States With No Income Tax

**No capital gains tax (9 states):**
- Alaska
- Florida
- Nevada
- New Hampshire
- South Dakota
- Tennessee
- Texas
- Washington
- Wyoming

**Huge advantage for high earners!**

### High Capital Gains Tax States

**2026 top combined rates (Federal 20% + State):**

| State | State Rate | Combined Rate | $50K Gain Tax |
|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| California | 13.3% | 33.3% | $16,650 |
| New York | 10.9% | 30.9% | $15,450 |
| New Jersey | 10.75% | 30.75% | $15,375 |
| Oregon | 9.9% | 29.9% | $14,950 |
| Minnesota | 9.85% | 29.85% | $14,925 |
| DC | 10.75% | 30.75% | $15,375 |

**California vs Texas on $50K gain:**
- California: $16,650 tax
- Texas: $10,000 tax (federal only)
- **Difference: $6,650!**

### How State Tax is Calculated

**California example:**
- Federal long-term rate: 15%
- California rate: 13.3% (regular income tax, no preferential rate)
- **Combined: 28.3%** (not counting NIIT)

**Most states tax capital gains as regular income** (no special rate like federal)

### Residency Tricky Issues

**Moved mid-year:**

**Example: Move from CA to TX in July**
- Realize $100K capital gain in December (TX resident)
- California: May try to tax portion (were resident for 7 months)
- Texas: No state tax

**Safe harbor: Establish clear residency** before realizing large gains
- Change driver's license
- Register to vote
- Move primary residence
- Close CA bank accounts
- File declaration of domicile

**Timing gains after clean break = save thousands**

### Capital Gains Tax By State

**Low-rate states (under 5%):**
- Arizona: 3.5%
- Colorado: 4.55%
- North Dakota: 2.9%
- Pennsylvania: 3.07%

**Moderate-rate states (5-7%):**
- Georgia: 5.75%
- Illinois: 4.95% (flat)
- Indiana: 3.23%
- Michigan: 4.25%
- Ohio: ~4%

**High-rate states (over 7%):**
- Connecticut: 6.99%
- Idaho: 6.5%
- Iowa: 6%
- Massachusetts: 5% (but special 12% on short-term gains!)
- Vermont: 8.75%
- Wisconsin: 7.65%

**Massachusetts special rule:**
Short-term gains: 12%!
Long-term gains: 5%

**Extreme penalty for short-term trades in MA**

## Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategies

### What is Tax-Loss Harvesting?

**Sell investments at a loss to offset gains**

**Example:**
- Stock A: $10,000 gain
- Stock B: down $4,000
- Sell both

**Tax impact:**
- Net gain: $10,000 - $4,000 = $6,000
- Tax at 15%: $900 (saved $600 by harvesting loss)

**Then:** Buy similar (not identical) stock to maintain exposure

### The $3,000 Annual Loss Deduction

**Losses exceed gains:**

**Scenario:**
- Gains: $5,000
- Losses: $12,000
- Net: -$7,000 loss

**Can deduct:**
- Offset all gains: $5,000
- Plus up to $3,000 against ordinary income
- **Total current year: $8,000**

**Remaining $-7,000 - $8,000 used = still have losses**
Actually: -$7,000 + $5,000 gains = -$2,000 remaining

Let me recalculate:
- Losses: $12,000
- Gains: $5,000
- Net loss: $7,000
- Use: $5,000 (offset gains) + $3,000 (against income) = $8,000 used
- **Carry forward: $0** (Wait, this is wrong—should be -$7,000 loss)

**Correct:**
- Net capital loss: $7,000
- Offset against ordinary income: $3,000
- **Carry forward to next year: $4,000**

**Capital losses never expire—carry forward forever**

### Wash Sale Rule

**Cannot claim loss if you buy "substantially identical" security within 30 days**

**Wash sale period: 61 days**
- 30 days before sale
- Day of sale
- 30 days after sale

**Example: Sell stock at loss**
- Sell AAPL on Dec 15 at $5,000 loss
- Buy AAPL on Dec 20
- **Loss disallowed!** (wash sale)

**Workarounds:**
- Buy similar but not identical (buy MSFT instead of AAPL)
- Buy ETF instead of individual stock
- Wait 31 days to repurchase
- Have spouse buy in their account (risky—IRS may disallow)

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategy

**Annual tax-loss harvesting:**

**December each year:**
1. Review portfolio
2. Identify positions with losses
3. Check if you have gains this year
4. Sell losers to offset gains
5. Immediately buy similar securities (avoid wash sale)
6. Maintain market exposure

**Example: End of year portfolio**
- Tech stock A: $20,000 gain (sell, take profit)
- Tech stock B: $8,000 loss (sell, offset)
- Immediately buy: Tech ETF (maintain exposure)
- Net gain: $12,000 (taxable)
- Saved: $8,000 × 15% = $1,200 in taxes

**January 1:** Can buy back original stock (31 days later, no wash sale)

### Long-Term Tax-Loss Harvesting Partners

**Match loss character with gain character:**

**Long-term gain?** Harvest long-term loss (better offset)
**Short-term gain?** Harvest short-term loss (better offset)

**Optimal:** Offset short-term gains (taxed high) with short-term losses

**If have both:**
1. ST losses offset ST gains first
2. Remaining ST losses offset LT gains (good!)
3. LT losses offset LT gains
4. Net loss: Deduct $3,000 vs ordinary income

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Example

**Portfolio situation:**
- Stock A: $30,000 gain (long-term)
- Stock B: $8,000 loss (long-term, unrealized)
- Stock C: $5,000 loss (long-term, unrealized)
- Income: $180,000 (24% bracket)

**Strategy 1: Don't harvest**
- Sell Stock A only
- Gain: $30,000
- Tax: $4,500 (15% × $30K)

**Strategy 2: Harvest losses**
- Sell A, B, and C
- Gains: $30,000
- Losses: $13,000
- Net: $17,000
- Tax: $2,550 (15% × $17K)

**Savings: $1,950**

**Then:** Buy replacements for B and C (maintain exposure)

## How to Minimize Capital Gains Tax

### Strategy 1: Hold Long-Term

**Simplest strategy: Wait 12+ months**

**$50,000 gain:**
- Short-term (24% bracket): $12,000 tax
- Long-term (15% rate): $7,500 tax
- **Saved: $4,500** (just by waiting)

### Strategy 2: Time Sales in Low-Income Years

**Scenario: Between jobs**

**Normal income: $120,000 (24% bracket, 15% LT gains)**

**Sabbatical year income: $40,000 (12% bracket)**

**Sell $50,000 of appreciated stock:**
- Single filer
- Income: $40,000 + $50,000 = $90,000
- Under $9 4,000 married or $47,000 single threshold?

Let me recalculate for single:
- Income w/ gains: $90,000
- Single 0% LT threshold: $47,000
- Over threshold, so 15% applies

Actually: Need to be more precise with taxable income vs MAGI.

**Better example: Retiree**
- Retirement income: $35,000
- Realize $25,000 LT gains
- Total: $60,000
- Single filer under $47K for gains? No, total is $60K.
- But first $47K of taxable income can have 0% on gains

**Complex—but KEY:** Low-income years = opportunity for 0% or lower LT rate

### Strategy 3: Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Roth IRA/401k:**
- All gains tax-free forever
- No capital gains tax on sales within account

**Traditional IRA/401k:**
- Gains grow tax-deferred
- Pay ordinary income tax on withdrawal (not capital gains—actually worse)
- But no tax during accumulation

**HSA:**
- Tax-free growth
- Tax-free withdrawal (for medical)
- Can trade stocks within HSA with no tax

**529 Plan:**
- Tax-free growth for education
- No capital gains on trades within account

**Maximize these accounts first** before taxable investing

### Strategy 4: Gift Appreciated Assets

**To children in low bracket:**
- Your basis: $10,000
- Value now: $30,000
- Gift to child (college student, no income)
- Child sells: $20,000 gain, pays 0% LT rate
- **Tax: $0**

**You sell:** $20,000 × 15% = $3,000 tax

**Saved: $3,000**

**Limits:**
- Kiddie tax rules (under 19, or under 24 if student)
- Gift tax consideration ($18,000/year per person)

**To charity:**
- Donate stock worth $10,000 (basis $2,000)
- Charity sells, pays no tax (tax-exempt)
- You deduct $10,000 fair market value
- **Avoid $1,200 capital gains tax (15% × $8K), get $2,400 income tax deduction (24% × $10K)**

**Win-win** if charitably inclined

### Strategy 5: Primary Residence Exclusion

**Sell primary home:**
- $250,000 gain exclusion (single)
- $500,000 gain exclusion (married)

**Requirements:**
- Owned 2+ years
- Lived in as primary residence 2 of last 5 years

**Example: Married couple**
- Bought: $300,000
- Sold: $850,000
- Gain: $550,000
- Exclusion: $500,000
- Taxable: $50,000
- Tax at 15%: $7,500

**Huge benefit!** Most Americans never pay capital gains on home sale.

### Strategy 6: Opportunity Zones

**Invest capital gains in Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund:**

**Benefits:**
- Defer capital gains tax until 2026 or when you sell QOZ investment
- Reduce deferred gain by 10% (if held 5+ years)
- Eliminate ALL tax on QOZ investment gains (if held 10+ years)

**Example:**
- Realize $100,000 capital gain
- Invest in QOZ within 180 days
- Defer $100K tax until 2026
- Hold QOZ 10 years
- QOZ grows to $200,000
- Sell QOZ: $100,000 gain tax-free!

**Complex, requires long commitment, but powerful**

### Strategy 7: Die With Appreciated Assets

**Morbid but effective: Step-up in basis at death**

**Your situation:**
- Stock basis: $50,000
- Current value: $500,000
- Unrealized gain: $450,000

**If you sell:** $450,000 × 15% = $67,500 tax

**If you die and pass to heirs:**
- Heir's basis: $500,000 (stepped up)
- Heir sells immediately: $0 gain
- **Tax: $0**

**$67,500 saved** by not selling before death

**Strategy for retirees:**
- Sell low-basis assets early (when needed for spending)
- Keep highest-basis assets until death (avoid tax forever)

### Strategy 8: 1031 Exchange (Real Estate)

**Investment property: Defer gain by buying replacement**

**Requirements:**
- Like-kind property (real estate for real estate)
- Must identify replacement within 45 days
- Must close within 180 days
- Use qualified intermediary

**Example:**
- Sell rental property: $400,000 gain
- Buy new rental within 180 days
- Defer all $400,000 gain
- **Tax: $0 (deferred)**

**Can repeat indefinitely** (until death, then basis steps up!)

**Not available for stocks** (only real estate)

## Real Capital Gains Tax Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tech Employee Stock Options

**Profile:**
- Income: $150,000
- Received ISOs (Incentive Stock Options) 3 years ago
- Exercised 2 years ago at $10/share (1,000 shares)
- Stock now worth $110/share
- Married filing jointly

**Analysis: Sell now**
- Proceeds: 1,000 × $110 = $110,000
- Basis: 1,000 × $10 = $10,000
- Gain: $100,000 (long-term)

**Tax:**
- Income with gain: $250,000
- Under NIIT threshold ($250K): No NIIT
- LT cap gains rate: 15%
- Federal: $100,000 × 15% = $15,000
- State (California): $100,000 × 13.3% = $13,300
- **Total: $28,300** (28.3% effective)

**After-tax proceeds:** $110,000 - $28,300 = $81,700

**Decision: Hold or sell?**
- If stock drops 25%: Would have $82,500 before tax (still better)
- If stock rises 25%: Would have $137,500 before tax, $40K+ tax
- **Risk tolerance determines answer**

### Scenario 2: Retiree Using 0% Rate

**Profile:**
- Age: 63 (retired)
- Social Security: $28,000
- Pension: $0
- Investment portfolio: $800,000
- Married filing jointly

**Strategy: Realize $60,000 gains annually**
- Income: $28,000
- Plus gains: $60,000
- Total: $88,000
- Under $94,000 married 0% threshold: YES
- **Federal capital gains tax: $0!**

**Over 10 years:**
- Realize $600,000 gains tax-free
- Saved: $600,000 × 15% = $90,000!

**At age 73 (RMDs start):**
- Higher income from Traditional IRA withdrawals
- May jump to 15% bracket
- But already converted portfolio to realized low-basis

**Brilliant strategy for early retirement years**

### Scenario 3: Tax-Loss Harvesting Portfolio

**Profile:**
- Income: $200,000
- Portfolio: $500,000
- Volatile year: Some up, some down

**December review:**
- Stock A: $40,000 gain (planning to sell)
- Stock B: $15,000 loss (still like the sector)
- Stock C: $8,000 loss (ready to move on)

**Strategy:**
- Sell A, B, and C
- Gains: $40,000
- Losses: $23,000
- Net: $17,000
- Buy similar ETF to replace B immediately
- Buy B again in February (no wash sale)

**Tax (single filer):**
- Net gain: $17,000
- Rate: 15%
- Tax: $2,550

**Without harvesting:**
- Gain: $40,000
- Tax: $6,000

**Savings: $3,450** (from one year of harvesting)

**Do this every year for decades!**

### Scenario 4: Crypto Gains

**Profile:**
- Bought Bitcoin: $20,000 (2022)
- Value now: $120,000 (2026)
- Held 4 years
- Single, $95,000 income

**Sale tax:**
- Gain: $100,000 (long-term)
- Income with gain: $190,000
- Under $200K NIIT: Yes
- LT rate: 15%
- Federal: $15,000

**State (Colorado):**
- Colorado: 4.55%
- State tax: $4,550

**Total tax: $19,550** (19.55%)

**After-tax proceeds:** $120,000 - $19,550 = $100,450

**Mistake many make: Think crypto isn't taxed**
Crypto taxed SAME as stocks!

### Scenario 5: Inherited Stock

**Profile:**
- Inherited stock from grandmother
- Her basis: $30,000 (bought 1980)
- Value at death (2024): $300,000
- Your basis (step-up): $300,000
- You sell immediately: $310,000

**Tax:**
- Gain: $310,000 - $300,000 = $10,000
- Holding period: Always long-term for inherited assets
- Tax at 15%: $1,500

**If there was NO step-up:**
- Gain: $310,000 - $30,000 = $280,000
- Tax at 15%: $42,000

**Step-up saved: $40,500!**

**This is why wealthy keep appreciated assets until death**

### Scenario 6: Moving States Tax Play

**Profile:**
- Live in California
- Want to sell startup stock: $2 million gain
- Single filer

**If sell in California:**
- Federal (20% + 3.8% NIIT): $476,000
- California (13.3%): $266,000
- **Total: $742,000** (37.1%)

**If move to Florida first:**
- Federal: $476,000
- Florida: $0
- **Total: $476,000** (23.8%)

**Saved: $266,000!**

**Strategy:**
1. Resign job, move to FL
2. Establish residency (6+ months)
3. Sell stock
4. Save $266K

**Worth it?** Absolutely for large gains!

**California's FTB watches for this** (prove legitimate move, not tax dodge)

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Hold 12+ months for long-term rates:** 15-20% vs 24-37% short-term can save thousands

✓ **Low earners can use 0% rate:** Under $47K single ($94K married) = zero long-term capital gains tax

✓ **NIIT adds 3.8% for high earners:** Over $200K single ($250K married) face 18.8-23.8% federal rates

✓ **State taxes vary enormously:** California 13.3% vs Texas/Florida 0% = $13,300 vs $0 on $100K gain

✓ **Tax-loss harvesting saves money:** Offset gains with losses annually, carry forward unused losses forever

✓ **Track cost basis carefully:** Include reinvested dividends, commissions, splits—missing basis = overpaying tax

✓ **Use tax-advantaged accounts:** Roth IRA, 401k, HSA grow tax-free, eliminating capital gains entirely

✓ **Primary residence exclusion is huge:** $250K/$500K tax-free on home sale for most homeowners

## Conclusion

Capital gains taxes can consume 15-40% of investment profits depending on holding period, income level, state of residence, and strategic timing. The single most impactful decision is holding investments longer than 12 months—converting short-term gains taxed at 24-37% to long-term gains taxed at 0-20%—potentially saving $2,000-4,000 per $10,000 gain for moderate earners.

State residency matters enormously: California's 13.3% state capital gains tax means selling a $1 million gain costs $133,000 to California vs $0 to Texas or Florida residents. High-income individuals facing $2 million+ gains can save $200,000-500,000 by establishing legitimate residency in a no-tax state before selling.

The 0% long-term rate for low-income filers is profoundly underutilized: retirees with less than $47,000 (single) or $94,000 (married) taxable income can realize tens of thousands in capital gains completely tax-free. This makes early retirement years (after leaving work, before required minimum distributions start) the optimal window for selling appreciated positions.

Tax-loss harvesting—selling losers to offset winners—provides annual tax savings that compound over decades. Harvesting $10,000 in losses annually saves $1,500/year at 15% rate, totaling $30,000 over 20 years. Combined with specific lot identification (selling highest-cost shares first), strategic investors can reduce lifetime capital gains taxes by 20-40%.
