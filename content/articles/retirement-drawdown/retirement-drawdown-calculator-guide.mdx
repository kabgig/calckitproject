## What is Retirement Drawdown?

### Definition

**Retirement drawdown** is the systematic withdrawal of money from your retirement savings to cover living expenses during retirement.

**Also called:**
- Withdrawal strategy
- Decumulation
- Spend-down phase
- Distribution planning

**Opposite of:** Accumulation (saving and building wealth)

### Why It Matters

**The Challenge:**
- Savings must last 20-40+ years
- Can't predict market returns
- Inflation erodes purchasing power
- Healthcare costs increase with age
- Can't easily replace depleted savings

**The Goal:**
Balance income needs with portfolio longevity—enjoy today without jeopardizing tomorrow.

### Key Factors

**Withdrawal Rate:**
Annual withdrawal as percentage of portfolio

Example: Withdraw $40,000 from $1M portfolio = 4% rate

**Time Horizon:**
How many years savings must last

- Age 65 retirement, live to 95 = 30 years
- Age 60 early retirement, live to 90 = 30 years
- Age 70 delayed retirement, live to 90 = 20 years

**Portfolio Allocation:**
Stock/bond mix affects sustainability

- Aggressive (80% stocks): Higher growth, higher volatility
- Moderate (60% stocks): Balanced
- Conservative (40% stocks): Lower volatility, lower growth

## The 4% Rule Explained

### What Is the 4% Rule?

**The Rule:**
Withdraw 4% of your portfolio in year one of retirement, then adjust that dollar amount for inflation each subsequent year.

**Example:**
- Portfolio: $1,000,000
- Year 1 withdrawal: $40,000 (4%)
- Year 2 withdrawal: $41,200 (adjusted for 3% inflation)
- Year 3 withdrawal: $42,436 (adjusted again)

### The Trinity Study

**Origin:**
1998 study by three professors at Trinity University

**Research:**
- Analyzed historical returns (1926-1995)
- Tested various withdrawal rates
- Different portfolio allocations
- Different time horizons (15-30 years)

**Finding:**
4% withdrawal rate had 95% success probability over 30 years with 50% stocks / 50% bonds portfolio.

**"Success"** = Portfolio never depleted before end of period

### Success Rates by Withdrawal Rate

| Withdrawal Rate | 30-Year Success | 40-Year Success |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3% | 100% | 98% |
| 4% | 95% | 85% |
| 5% | 79% | 55% |
| 6% | 57% | 27% |
| 7% | 38% | 12% |

**Portfolio:** 50% stocks, 50% bonds  
**Based on:** Historical US market data

### Calculating Your 4% Rule Number

**Formula:**
```
Annual Withdrawal = Portfolio Value × 0.04
```

**Examples:**

$500,000 × 0.04 = **$20,000/year**

$1,000,000 × 0.04 = **$40,000/year**

$1,500,000 × 0.04 = **$60,000/year**

$2,000,000 × 0.04 = **$80,000/year**

**Reverse calculation** (how much you need):
```
Portfolio Needed = Annual Expenses ÷ 0.04
```

**Examples:**

Need $50,000/year: $50,000 ÷ 0.04 = **$1,250,000**

Need $80,000/year: $80,000 ÷ 0.04 = **$2,000,000**

Need $120,000/year: $120,000 ÷ 0.04 = **$3,000,000**

### Limitations of the 4% Rule

**Criticism 1: Based on Historical Data**
- Past returns don't guarantee future results
- Current valuations higher than historical average
- Bond yields lower than historical average
- Some experts now suggest 3-3.5% safer

**Criticism 2: Inflexible**
- Doesn't adjust for market conditions
- Same withdrawal in boom and bust years
- Ignores personal circumstances
- May be too conservative and leave money unspent

**Criticism 3: US-Centric**
- Based only on US stock/bond returns
- International returns often lower
- Global portfolio may require lower rate

**Criticism 4: Doesn't Account For:**
- Social Security income
- Pensions
- Part-time work
- Healthcare costs before Medicare
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

**Despite criticisms:** Still valuable starting point for planning.

## Dynamic Withdrawal Strategies

Instead of fixed 4%, adjust withdrawals based on conditions.

### Strategy 1: Variable Percentage Withdrawal

**Method:**
Withdraw fixed percentage of current portfolio value each year.

**Example (4% variable):**
- Year 1: Portfolio $1M → Withdraw $40,000
- Year 2: Portfolio $1.1M → Withdraw $44,000
- Year 3: Portfolio $950K → Withdraw $38,000

**Pros:**
- Portfolio never depletes (mathematically)
- Adjusts automatically to market
- Simple to calculate

**Cons:**
- Income fluctuates significantly
- May be too low in down markets
- Hard to budget with variable income

### Strategy 2: Guardrails Approach

**Method:**
Set upper and lower boundaries for withdrawals.

**Example:**
- Base withdrawal: $50,000 (5% of $1M)
- Upper guardrail: $60,000 (20% increase)
- Lower guardrail: $42,500 (15% decrease)

**Rules:**
- If portfolio grows significantly, increase withdrawal (up to upper limit)
- If portfolio declines significantly, decrease withdrawal (down to lower limit)
- Otherwise, adjust only for inflation

**Pros:**
- Balance between flexibility and stability
- Allows spending increases when market is strong
- Protects portfolio in downturns
- More realistic than fixed 4%

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- Requires discipline to cut spending

### Strategy 3: Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Method

**Method:**
Use IRS RMD percentages even before age 73.

**RMD Factors:**
| Age | Withdrawal % |
|-----|--------------|
| 60 | 3.65% |
| 65 | 4.07% |
| 70 | 4.55% |
| 75 | 5.35% |
| 80 | 6.49% |
| 85 | 8.20% |
| 90 | 11.11% |

**Example (Age 70):**
Portfolio $1M × 4.55% = $45,500 withdrawal

**Pros:**
- Increases with age (matches decreasing life expectancy)
- Based on actuarial tables
- Forced to take once reach RMD age anyway

**Cons:**
- Withdrawal rate may feel low initially
- Increases significantly in later years
- Complex factor tables

### Strategy 4: Bucket Strategy

**Method:**
Divide portfolio into three "buckets" by time horizon.

**Bucket 1 (Years 1-5):**
- Cash, CDs, money market
- $250,000 for $50K/year spending
- No market risk

**Bucket 2 (Years 6-15):**
- Bonds, conservative investments
- $500,000
- Low-moderate risk
- Replenish Bucket 1 as needed

**Bucket 3 (Years 16+):**
- Stocks, growth investments  
- $750,000
- Higher risk, higher growth
- Replenish Bucket 2 as needed

**Pros:**
- Mental peace: Years 1-5 fully secured
- Can ignore short-term market volatility
- Growth potential in later buckets
- Clear structure

**Cons:**
- Complex to manage and rebalance
- Cash drag on returns (Bucket 1 doesn't grow)
- Need to maintain discipline

### Strategy 5: Floor-and-Upside

**Method:**
Create income floor with guaranteed sources, then add variable withdrawals.

**Floor Income (Essential Expenses):**
- Social Security: $30,000
- Pension: $15,000
- Annuity: $10,000
**Total floor: $55,000**

**Variable Withdrawals (Discretionary):**
- From portfolio based on market conditions
- $15,000-$30,000 depending on performance

**Total income:** $70,000-$85,000

**Pros:**
- Essential expenses always covered
- Can spend more when market is good
- Mental security
- Flexible discretionary spending

**Cons:**
- Requires purchasing annuity or pension
- Less liquidity in guaranteed portion
- Annuity fees can be high

## Safe Withdrawal Rates by Age

### Early Retirement (Age 50-60)

**Challenge:** Potentially 40+ year time horizon

**Recommended Rate:** 3-3.5%

**Example:**
$1,500,000 portfolio × 3.25% = **$48,750/year**

**Considerations:**
- No Social Security yet (earliest is 62)
- No Medicare (age 65)
- Health insurance expensive
- More years to fund

**Strategy:** Conservative rate, flexible spending, consider part-time work

### Traditional Retirement (Age 65-70)

**Challenge:** 25-30 year time horizon

**Recommended Rate:** 4-4.5%

**Example:**
$1,200,000 portfolio × 4% = **$48,000/year**

Plus Social Security: $25,000  
**Total: $73,000/year**

**Considerations:**
- Medicare coverage starts
- Social Security available
- Reduced healthcare costs
- More stable income

**Strategy:** Classic 4% rule appropriate

### Late Retirement (Age 70+)

**Challenge:** 20-25 year time horizon

**Recommended Rate:** 5-6%

**Example:**
$1,000,000 portfolio × 5.5% = **$55,000/year**

Plus maximized Social Security: $35,000  
**Total: $90,000/year**

**Considerations:**
- Shorter time horizon allows higher rate
- Higher Social Security (delayed until 70)
- Required Minimum Distributions  start age 73
- Healthcare costs may increase

**Strategy:** Can withdraw more aggressively

### Withdrawal Rate by Portfolio Size

**Smaller portfolios** (under $500K):
May need higher withdrawal rate (5-6%) but higher risk of depletion. Supplement with:
- Part-time work
- Downsizing home
- Relocating to lower cost area

**Medium portfolios** ($500K-$2M):
4-5% rate appropriate, balance income needs with sustainability

**Larger portfolios** (over $2M):
Can use lower rate (3-4%), leaving legacy, or higher rate for lifestyle

## Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequence

The order you withdraw from accounts dramatically affects tax burden and portfolio longevity.

### Account Types

**Taxable Accounts:**
- Regular brokerage accounts
- Savings, CDs
- Tax: Capital gains (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income)

**Tax-Deferred:**
- Traditional 401(k)
- Traditional IRA
- SEP IRA
- Tax: Ordinary income (10-37%)

**Tax-Free:**
- Roth IRA
- Roth 401(k)
- HSA (for medical)
- Tax: None

### Traditional Withdrawal Sequence

**Order 1 → 5:**

**1. Taxable accounts first**
- Benefit from capital gains rates (usually lower than ordinary income)
- No RMDs, can time strategically
- Access without penalty at any age

**2. Tax-deferred accounts**
- Traditional 401(k), Traditional IRA
- Must start RMDs at age 73
- Withdraw enough to stay in target tax bracket

**3. Tax-free accounts last**
- Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)
- Maximum growth potential
- No RMDs (Roth IRA)
- Leave for later years or heirs

**Strategy:** Deplete higher-taxed accounts first, preserve tax-free growth.

### Example Sequence

**Age 65-72:**
Withdraw from taxable accounts only.

- Portfolio value: $1,500,000
- Taxable: $400,000
- Tax-deferred: $900,000
- Roth: $200,000

Years 1-8: Withdraw $50,000/year from taxable ($400,000 total)

**Age 73-80:**
Required to take RMDs, plus additional from tax-deferred.

Years 9-16: RMD + extra from Traditional IRA

**Age 81+:**
Roth IRA for tax-free income and legacy.

### Advanced: Roth Conversions

**Strategy:**
Convert Traditional IRA to Roth IRA in low-income years (early retirement, before Social Security).

**Benefit:**
- Pay taxes now at lower rate
- Grow tax-free thereafter
- Reduce future RMDs
- More tax-free income later

**Example:**
Age 62-65 (before Social Security):
- Income: $30,000 from portfolio
- Tax bracket: 12%
- Convert $30,000/year Traditional → Roth
- Pay 12% tax (low rate)

Age 70+ (with Social Security):
- Would have been in 22-24% bracket
- Now have tax-free Roth instead
- Saved 10-12% tax

### Tax Bracket Management

**Strategy:** Stay within target tax bracket through strategic withdrawals.

**2026 Tax Brackets (Single):**
- 10%: Up to $11,600
- 12%: $11,601-$47,150
- 22%: $47,151-$100,525
- 24%: $100,526-$191,950

**Example Strategy:**
- Goal: Stay in 12% bracket
- Limit: $47,150 income
- Social Security: $25,000
- Max traditional withdrawal: $22,150
- Fill remaining need from Roth (tax-free, doesn't count)

## Adjusting for Market Conditions

### Market Valuation Impact

**High Valuations = Lower Expected Returns**

**Shiller CAPE Ratio:**
- Historical average: 17
- When over 25: Lower future returns expected
- When over 30: Significantly lower returns expected
- Current (2026): ~28

**Adjustment:**
When CAPE over 25, consider reducing withdrawal rate by 0.5-1%

### Sequence of Returns Risk

**The Danger:**
Poor returns early in retirement can devastate portfolio even if long-term returns are good.

**Example:**

**Scenario A - Good Early Returns:**
- Year 1: +10% ($1M → $1.1M, withdraw $40K = $1.06M)
- Year 2: +8% ($1.06M → $1.145M, withdraw $41K = $1.104M)
- Year 3: -5% ($1.104M → $1.049M, withdraw $42K = $1.007M)

**Scenario B - Poor Early Returns:**
- Year 1: -5% ($1M → $950K, withdraw $40K = $910K)
- Year 2: +8% ($910K → $983K, withdraw $41K = $942K)
- Year 3: +10% ($942K → $1.036M, withdraw $42K = $994K)

**Same average return, but Scenario B portfolio $13K lower** due to poor sequence.

### Bear Market Adjustments

**Strategy: Pause Inflation Adjustments**

Instead of increasing withdrawal for inflation, freeze at previous dollar amount.

**Normal 4% rule:**
- Year 1: $50,000
- Year 2: $51,500 (3% inflation adjustment)
- Year 3: $53,045

**During bear market (Year 2):**
- Year 1: $50,000
- Year 2: $50,000 (freeze, skip inflation)
- Year 3: $51,500 (resume adjustments)

**Impact:** Significantly increases portfolio survival probability.

### Dynamic Adjustment Formula

**Annual Check:**

```
If portfolio value ≥ (initial value × inflation adjustment):
  Proceed with normal withdrawal
Else:
  Reduce withdrawal by 10%
```

**Example:**
- Initial: $1,000,000
- Year 5, after 3% avg inflation: Target $1,159,000
- Actual portfolio: $1,050,000 (below target)
- Action: Reduce withdrawal from $46,000 to $41,400

## Common Drawdown Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Social Security Timing

**The Error:**
Not optimizing Social Security claiming age.

**Impact:**

**Claim at 62:**
Permanent 30% reduction
$2,000/month → $1,400/month = -$600/month

**Wait until 70:**
32% increase over full retirement age
$2,000/month → $2,640/month = +$640/month

**Difference:** $24/month ($30K/year) for life!

**Strategy:** 
If you can afford it, delay Social Security and live on portfolio early. Once maximized Social Security starts, reduce portfolio withdrawals.

### Mistake 2: Withdrawing Fixed Dollar Amount

**The Error:**
"I need exactly $60,000/year" regardless of market.

**Problem:**
Massive bear market means withdrawing $60K from $800K portfolio = 7.5% rate (unsustainable)

**Better approach:**
Build flexibility into budget. Essential vs. discretionary expenses.

**Example Budget:**
- Essential: $45,000 (must have)
- Discretionary: $15,000 (nice to have)

In bear market, cut discretionary temporarily.

### Mistake 3: Not Accounting for Healthcare

**The Error:**
Underestimating healthcare costs.

**Reality:**
- Age 65+ couple: $315,000 lifetime healthcare costs (Fidelity 2024 estimate)
- Long-term care: $100,000-$300,000+
- Medicare doesn't cover everything

**Solution:**
- Budget separate healthcare allocation
- Consider long-term care insurance
- HSA funds for medical (triple tax advantaged)

### Mistake 4: Overconcentration in One Asset

**The Error:**
Retiring with 100% stocks or 100% bonds.

**Problem:**
- 100% stocks: Too volatile, sequence risk
- 100% bonds: Can't keep up with inflation

**Better:**
Balanced allocation

**Common allocations:**
- Conservative: 40% stocks / 60% bonds
- Moderate: 60% stocks / 40% bonds
- Aggressive: 80% stocks / 20% bonds

**Rule of thumb:** Bonds = your age (at 70 = 70% bonds) [Conservative rule]

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Required Minimum Distributions

**The Error:**
Failing to plan for RMDs starting age 73.

**Problem:**
RMDs may push you into higher tax bracket, increase Medicare premiums, make Social Security taxable.

**Solution:**
- Roth conversions before age 73
- Strategic withdrawals in 60s
- QCDs (Qualified Charitable Distributions) to satisfy RMD without tax

### Mistake 6: Leaving Too Much

**The Error:**
Being too conservative and dying with millions unspent.

**Reality Check:**
You spent 40 years saving—it's okay to spend it!

**Common regret:**
"I wish I'd traveled more in my 60s when I was healthier."

**Strategy:**
- Plan larger withdrawals for "go-go years" (60s-70s)
- Reduce for "slow-go years" (70s-80s)
- Minimal for "no-go years" (85+)

## Real Retirement Drawdown Examples

### Example 1: Traditional Retirement (Age 65)

**Starting Position:**
- Portfolio: $1,250,000
  - Traditional 401(k): $800,000
  - Roth IRA: $250,000
  - Taxable brokerage: $200,000
- Social Security (age 67): $28,000/year
- Expenses: $65,000/year

**Strategy:**
Years 1-2 (Age 65-66): Withdraw $65,000 from taxable account

Years 3+ (Age 67+): 
- Social Security: $28,000
- Portfolio withdrawal: $37,000 (from Traditional 401(k))
- Total: $65,000

**Withdrawal rate:** $37,000 ÷ $1,050,000 remaining = 3.5%

**Projected longevity:** 30+ years with high confidence

### Example 2: Early Retirement (Age 55)

**Starting Position:**
- Portfolio: $2,000,000
  - Traditional 401(k): $1,200,000
  - Roth IRA: $400,000
  - Taxable: $400,000
- Social Security (age 70): $40,000/year
- Expenses: $80,000/year

**Strategy:**
Years 1-10 (Age 55-64):
- Withdraw $80,000/year from taxable, then Traditional 401(k) (using Rule 72(t) or Substantially Equal Periodic Payments to avoid penalty)
- Convert $30,000/year to Roth in low tax years

Years 11-15 (Age 65-69):
- Reduce withdrawal to $60,000 (part-time work $20K)
- Continue Roth conversions

Years 16+ (Age 70+):
- Social Security: $40,000 (maximized)
- Portfolio: $30,000
- Part-time work: $10,000 (optional)
- Total: $80,000

**Initial withdrawal rate:** 4% (appropriate for 40-year horizon)

### Example 3: Late Retirement (Age 70)

**Starting Position:**
- Portfolio: $900,000
  - Traditional IRA: $600,000
  - Roth IRA: $200,000
  - Savings: $100,000
- Social Security (immediate, maximized): $42,000/year
- Pension: $18,000/year
- Expenses: $75,000/year

**Strategy:**
- Social Security: $42,000
- Pension: $18,000
- Portfolio needed: $15,000/year

**Withdrawal rate:** $15,000 ÷ $900,000 = 1.67%

**Analysis:** 
Extremely safe. Portfolio will likely grow, not shrink. Could:
- Spend more on travel/lifestyle
- Leave larger inheritance
- Gift to family/charity now

### Example 4: Failed Drawdown (Cautionary)

**Starting Position:**
- Portfolio: $800,000
- Social Security: $24,000/year
- Desired spending: $80,000/year

**Attempt:**
Withdraw $56,000 from portfolio

**Withdrawal rate:** $56,000 ÷ $800,000 = 7%

**Problem:** Way too high!

**Sequence:**
- Year 1: $800K → withdraw $56K → $744K
- Market -10%: $744K → $670K
- Year 2: withdraw $56K → $614K
- Year 3: withdraw $56K → $558K

**At this pace:** Portfolio depleted in 10-12 years!

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce spending to $50,000 total ($26K from portfolio = 3.25%)
2. Work part-time for 5 more years
3. Downsize home, live on $24K Social Security + proceeds
4. Relocate to lower cost of living area

## Key Takeaways

✓ **4% rule**: Classic guideline, withdraw 4% in year one, adjust for inflation thereafter

✓ **Dynamic strategies**: Adjust withdrawals based on market conditions, more realistic than fixed amount

✓ **Account sequence**: Taxable first, tax-deferred second, Roth last for tax efficiency

✓ **Flexibility is key**: Ability to reduce spending in downturns dramatically increases success

✓ **Longer retirement = lower rate**: Early retirement needs 3-3.5%, traditional retirement 4%, late retirement 5-6%

✓ **Social Security timing matters**: Delaying until 70 can increase lifetime income significantly

✓ **Expect the unexpected**: Bear markets early in retirement are the biggest risk, build contingency plans

✓ **Balance spending and longevity**: Don't be so conservative you never enjoy retirement, but don't be reckless

## Conclusion

The retirement drawdown phase requires as much planning as accumulation—maybe more. While the 4% rule provides a helpful starting point, real-world retirement demands flexibility, tax awareness, and willingness to adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

The most successful retirees build multiple income sources, maintain spending flexibility, understand tax implications of different account withdrawals, and regularly review their strategy rather than setting it once and forgetting it.
