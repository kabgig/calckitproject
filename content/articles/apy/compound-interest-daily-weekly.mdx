# Compound Interest: Daily vs Weekly vs Monthly Compounding

Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." But not all compounding is created equal. The frequency of compounding can significantly impact your returns—sometimes by thousands of dollars. This guide explains exactly how daily, weekly, monthly, and other compounding frequencies affect your money.

## What is Compounding?

**Compounding** is earning interest on your interest. Instead of only your principal earning returns, the interest you've already earned also starts generating returns.

### Simple Interest vs Compound Interest

**Simple Interest:**
- Calculated only on principal
- Same amount each period
- Linear growth

**Example**: $10,000 at 5% simple interest
- Year 1: $10,500
- Year 2: $11,000
- Year 3: $11,500

**Compound Interest:**
- Calculated on principal + accumulated interest
- Growing amount each period
- Exponential growth

**Example**: $10,000 at 5% compounded annually
- Year 1: $10,500
- Year 2: $11,025 (not $11,000!)
- Year 3: $11,576 (not $11,500!)

**Difference after 3 years**: $76 extra from compounding

Now imagine this over 30 years with daily compounding—the differences become massive!

## Compounding Frequencies Explained

### Annual Compounding (n = 1)

**How It Works:**
- Interest calculated once per year
- Added to balance December 31st (typically)
- Simplest compounding method

**Formula**: FV = P(1 + r)^t

**Example**: $10,000 at 5%
- Jan 1, Year 1: $10,000
- Dec 31, Year 1: $10,500
- Dec 31, Year 2: $11,025

**APY = APR** (both 5.00%)

**Where Used**: Some bonds, simple CDs

### Semi-Annual Compounding (n = 2)

**How It Works:**
- Interest calculated twice per year (every 6 months)
- Effective rate per period: annual rate ÷ 2

**Formula**: FV = P(1 + r/2)^(2t)

**Example**: $10,000 at 5%
- Jan 1: $10,000
- June 30: $10,250 (2.5% earned)
- Dec 31: $10,506.25 (2.5% on $10,250)

**APY = 5.063%** (higher than 5% APR!)

**Where Used**: Some corporate bonds

### Quarterly Compounding (n = 4)

**How It Works:**
- Interest calculated four times per year
- Effective rate per period: annual rate ÷ 4

**Formula**: FV = P(1 + r/4)^(4t)

**Example**: $10,000 at 5%
- End Q1: $10,125.00
- End Q2: $10,251.56
- End Q3: $10,379.71
- End Q4: $10,509.45

**APY = 5.095%**

**Where Used**: Traditional CDs, some savings accounts

### Monthly Compounding (n = 12)

**How It Works:**
- Interest calculated 12 times per year
- Effective rate per period: annual rate ÷ 12

**Formula**: FV = P(1 + r/12)^(12t)

**Example**: $10,000 at 5%
- Month 1: $10,041.67
- Month 2: $10,083.51
- Month 12: $10,511.62

**APY = 5.116%**

**Where Used**: Most savings accounts, many CDs, mortgages

### Weekly Compounding (n = 52)

**How It Works:**
- Interest calculated 52 times per year
- Effective rate per period: annual rate ÷ 52

**Formula**: FV = P(1 + r/52)^(52t)

**Example**: $10,000 at 5% for 1 year
- **Final Balance**: $10,512.54

**APY = 5.125%**

**Where Used**: Some credit union accounts, rare in mainstream banking

### Daily Compounding (n = 365)

**How It Works:**
- Interest calculated 365 times per year
- Effective rate per period: annual rate ÷ 365

**Formula**: FV = P(1 + r/365)^(365t)

**Example**: $10,000 at 5% for 1 year
- Day 1: $10,001.37
- Day 30: $10,041.10
- Day 365: $10,512.67

**APY = 5.127%**

**Where Used**: Most high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts

**Most Common in 2026!**

### Continuous Compounding (n = ∞)

**How It Works:**
- Mathematical concept of infinite compounding
- Uses natural logarithm (e)
- Theoretical maximum return

**Formula**: FV = P × e^(rt)

**Example**: $10,000 at 5% for 1 year
- **Final Balance**: $10,512.71

**APY = 5.127%** (essentially identical to daily)

**Where Used**: Advanced financial modeling, some DeFi protocols

## Why Banks Use Different Frequencies

### Historical Reasons

**Before computers:**
- Annual/quarterly was practical (manual calculations)
- Daily compounding computationally expensive

**Modern Era:**
- Daily is trivial for computers
- Banks can offer without additional cost

### Competitive Positioning

**Traditional Banks:**
- Often monthly/quarterly compounding
- Higher overhead, less competitive pressure
- APYs typically lower (0.01 - 0.50%)

**Online Banks:**
- Almost exclusively daily compounding
- Lower overhead allows better rates
- APYs typically higher (4.00% - 5.50%)

### Marketing

**Perception:**
- "Daily compounding!" sounds premium
- Actually costs bank nothing to offer
- Attracts rate-conscious customers

## Special Case: Mortgages

### How Mortgage Compounding Works

Mort gages use **monthly compounding** but:
- Interest calculated on **declining** balance
- You pay principal + interest monthly
- "Negative" compounding (you pay it)

**$300,000 at 4.5% for 30 years:**
- Monthly payment: $1,520.06
- Total paid: $547,220
- Total interest: $247,220

### Why This Matters

**Impact of Extra Payments:**
Extra $200/month:
- Payoff: 24 years instead of 30
- Interest saved: ~$72,000

The monthly compounding magnifies your extra payment impact!

## Special Case: Credit Cards

### The Dark Side of Daily Compounding

Credit cards compound **daily**, which hurts you:

**$1,000 balance at 20% APR:**
- Expected (simple): $200/year interest
- Actual (daily compound): $221/year interest

**That's 10.5% more than expected!**

### Why It Matters

Over time, credit card balances spiral due to daily compounding:

**$5,000 balance, minimum payments only:**
- Takes ~15 years to pay off
- Total interest: ~$6,400
- More interest than original balance!

## Optimizing for Compounding Frequency

### Choose Daily When Available

**For Savings:**
Same rate? Always choose daily compounding.
- $10,000 at 5%: Save $12.67/year vs. annual
- Larger balances: Difference scales proportionally

### Don't Sacrifice Rate for Frequency

**Better**: 5.00% APY monthly = **5.00%** effective  
**Worse**: 4.75% APY daily = **4.75%** effective

**Always compare APYs** (which already factor in compounding)!

### Consider Your Timeline

**Short-term (&lt;1 year)**: Compounding frequency matters less  
**Long-term (10+ years)**: Compounding frequency matters significantly

## Calculating Your Own Scenarios

### The Universal Formula

**FV = PV × (1 + r/n)^(n×t)**

Where:
- FV = Future value
- PV = Present value (initial amount)
- r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
- n = Compounding frequency per year
- t = Time in years

### Example Calculation

$15,000 at 4.25% daily compounding for 7 years:

- PV = 15,000
- r = 0.0425
- n = 365
- t = 7

**FV** = 15,000 × (1 + 0.0425/365)^(365×7)  
**FV** = 15,000 × (1.000116)^2555  
**FV** = 15,000 × 1.3536  
**FV** = **$20,304**

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth: "Continuous is Way Better"

**Reality**: Continuous is only 0.001% better than daily for practical rates
- Both effectively maximal
- Daily is real-world standard

### Myth: "Frequency Doesn't Matter Much"

**Reality**: Over long periods with large balances, thousands of dollars difference
- $100K, 30 years: ~$3,700 difference (daily vs. annual)
- Multiple accounts compounding: Multiplies the impact

### Myth: "I Should Always Reinvest Interest"

**Reality**: With automatic compounding, interest is automatically reinvested
- No action needed
- Happens whether you check balance or not

## When Frequency Doesn Understanding the time value of money concept is crucial. Interest earned today starts compounding immediately—generating returns on returns.

## Practical Tips

### 1. When Opening a Savings Account

**Ask**: "What is the compounding frequency?"  
**Best answer**: "Daily"  
**Acceptable**: "Monthly"  
**Avoid**: "Quarterly" or "Annual" (unless rate much higher)

### 2. Compare APYs, Not Rates

APY already includes compounding:
- 4.50% APR daily = 4.60% APY
- 4.65% APR annual = 4.65% APY
- **Choose**: The first one (higher APY)

### 3. Maximize Through Automation

Set up automatic transfers:
- Weekly: $50
- Monthly: $200

Combined with daily compounding = exponential growth

### 4. Don't Withdraw Interest

Let it compound:
- $10,000 base earning 5% APY
- Year 10: $16,470 (if left alone)
- Year 10: $15,000 (if withdrawing interest annual)
- **Difference**: $1,470 from compound effect
