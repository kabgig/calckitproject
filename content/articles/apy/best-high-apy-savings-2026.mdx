- Jan 2024: 4.50% APY typical
- Dec 2024: 5.25% APY typical
- Benefit: Automatic rate increases

### When Rates Fall

**Winners**: CDs with locked rates

- Savings rates might decrease
- 2-3 year CDs at 5%+ become attractive
- Consider CD ladders

## Account Security & Insurance

### FDIC Insurance Basics

- **Coverage**: $250,000 per depositor, per bank
- **Protection**: Bank failure (not market losses)
- **Automatic**: No application needed

### Maximizing Coverage

**Multiple Banks**
$500,000 to protect? Use 2+ banks to stay under $250K each

**Joint Accounts**
$500,000 coverage per joint account ($250K per owner)

**Pass-Through Insurance**
Some platforms (Wealthfront, etc.) partner with multiple banks:
- Spread across several banks automatically
- Each bank = $250K coverage
- Can achieve multi-million dollar insurance

## Opening Multiple High-APY Accounts

### Strategy: Account Stacking

Many savers use multiple accounts:

**Example Setup:**
1. **Emergency Fund** (3-6 months expenses): High-yield savings for instant access
2. **Short-Term Goals** (1-2 years): Money market or short-term CDs
3. **Medium-Term** (2-5 years): CD ladder
4. **Excess Cash**: Highest APY savings account

### Benefits of Multiple Accounts

- Maximize FDIC coverage
- Organize by goal
- Take advantage of promotional rates
- Diversify platform risk

### Downsides

- More accounts to monitor
- More tax forms (1099-INT from each)
- Can be logistically complex

## Tips to Maximize APY

### 1. Set Up Automatic Transfers

$500/month at 5% APY:
- Year 1: $6,150
- Year 5: $34,064
- Year 10: $77,641

### 2. Time Large Deposits

If expecting windfall:
- Research rates first
- Consider promotional offers
- Don't wait—compounding matters

### 3. Review Quarterly

- Check if your rate changed
- Compare to market rates
- Switch if significantly better option appears

### 4. Combine with CD Ladder

**3-Month CD**: 5.15% APY  
**6-Month CD**: 5.35% APY  
**12-Month CD**: 5.50% APY  

Ladder provides liquidity + higher rates

### 5. Use "Buckets" or SubAccounts

Organize psychologically:
- Emergency Fund bucket
- Vacation bucket
- Home Down Payment bucket

Ally, Marcus, and others offer this feature

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ⚠️ Promotional Rate Bait-and-Switch

**Problem**: "6% APY for 3 months, then 0.50%"  
**Solution**: Read fine print, set calendar reminder

### ⚠️ High Minimum Balance Requirements

**Problem**: "5% APY on balances above $100K"  
**Solution**: Calculate if you'll actually maintain that balance

### ⚠️ Transaction Restrictions

**Problem**: "First 3 transfers free, then $10 each"  
**Solution**: Choose accounts with unlimited transfers

### ⚠️ Hidden Monthly Fees

**Problem**: "$2.99/month maintenance fee"  
**Cost**: Reduces effective APY significantly  
**On $5,000**: $36/year fee = 0.72% drag on returns

### ⚠️ Complicated Access

**Problem**: 3-5 day transfer times, difficult withdrawals  
**Solution**: Test small transfer before moving large sums

## Tax Considerations

### Interest is Taxable

Every dollar of interest is ordinary income:
- Added to tax return (Form 1099-INT)
- Taxed at your marginal rate
- No preferential treatment (unlike capital gains)

### After-Tax APY

| Tax Bracket | 5% Nominal APY | After-Tax APY |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 10% | 5.00% | 4.50% |
| 22% | 5.00% | 3.90% |
| 24% | 5.00% | 3.80% |
| 32% | 5.00% | 3.40% |

**Still beats 0.01%!** Even after taxes, high APY accounts dominate.
