## Retirement Savings Rules of Thumb

### Rule 1: The 25x Rule

**Concept:**
Save 25 times your annual retirement expenses.

**How It Works:**
If you need $60,000/year in retirement:
- $60,000 × 25 = $1,500,000 retirement savings target

**Why It Works:**
Based on the 4% safe withdrawal rate. With $1.5M, you can withdraw $60,000/year (4%) without running out of money over a 30-year retirement.

**When to Use:**
- Planning 30+ year retirement
- Want conservative approach
- Don't have pension or large Social Security

### Rule 2: The 10x Final Salary Rule

**Concept:**
Save 10 times your final working salary by retirement age.

**Example:**
- Final salary: $100,000
- Retirement target: $1,000,000

**Adjustments:**
- More if retiring before 67: 12x salary
- Less if have pension: 8x salary
- More for expensive lifestyle: 12-15x salary

### Rule 3: The 80% Income Replacement Rule

**Concept:**
Plan to replace 80% of your pre-retirement income.

**Calculation:**
- Current income: $100,000
- Target retirement income: $80,000/year
- Needed savings (at 4% withdrawal): $2,000,000

**Why 80%?**
- No longer saving for retirement (15-20%)
- Lower taxes on retirement income
- Reduced work-related expenses
- Possibly downsized housing

## The 4% Withdrawal Rule

### Understanding the 4% Rule

The 4% rule suggests you can withdraw 4% of your retirement savings in year one, then adjust for inflation each year, with high probability your money will last 30 years.

**Example:**
- Retirement savings: $1,000,000
- Year 1 withdrawal: $40,000 (4%)
- Year 2 withdrawal: $41,200 (adjusted for 3% inflation)
- Year 3 withdrawal: $42,436 (adjusted again)

### Safe Withdrawal Rates by Retirement Length

**30-year retirement:**
- Conservative: 3.5%
- Moderate: 4.0%
- Aggressive: 4.5%

**40-year retirement:**
- Conservative: 3.0%
- Moderate: 3.5%
- Aggressive: 4.0%

**20-year retirement:**
- Conservative: 4.5%
- Moderate: 5.0%
- Aggressive: 5.5%

### When to Adjust the 4% Rule

**Use a Lower Rate (3-3.5%) If:**
- Retiring before age 60
- Want to leave inheritance
- Have high fixed expenses
- Conservative risk tolerance
- Concentrated in stocks

**Use a Higher Rate (4.5-5%) If:**
- Retiring after age 70
- Have guaranteed income (pension)
- Flexible on spending
- Willing to return to work if needed
- Have alternate income sources

## Retirement Savings by Age

### Savings Milestones by Age (Fidelity Guidelines)

**Age 30:**
- **Target:** 1x annual salary
- Example: $60,000 salary = $60,000 saved
- **How to get there:** Save 15% from age 25

**Age 35:**
- **Target:** 2x annual salary
- Example: $70,000 salary = $140,000 saved
- **Catch-up needed:** $400/month if behind

**Age 40:**
- **Target:** 3x annual salary
- Example: $80,000 salary = $240,000 saved
- **Catch-up needed:** $800/month if starting now

**Age 45:**
- **Target:** 4x annual salary
- Example: $90,000 salary = $360,000 saved
- **Catch-up needed:** $1,200/month if starting now

**Age 50:**
- **Target:** 6x annual salary
- Example: $100,000 salary = $600,000 saved
- **Catch-up contributions available:** $7,500 extra to 401(k)

**Age 55:**
- **Target:** 7x annual salary
- Example: $100,000 salary = $700,000 saved
- **Late-career growth:** Focus on maximizing contributions

**Age 60:**
- **Target:** 8x annual salary
- Example: $100,000 salary = $800,000 saved
- **Transition planning:** Begin withdrawal strategy

**Age 67 (Traditional Retirement Age):**
- **Target:** 10x annual salary
- Example: $100,000 salary = $1,000,000 saved
- **Social Security:** Full benefits available

## Common Retirement Planning Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Healthcare Costs

**The Reality:**
- Fidelity estimates $315,000 per couple for healthcare in retirement
- Medicare doesn't cover everything
- Long-term care can cost $100,000+/year

**The Solution:**
- Contribute to HSA
- Plan for Medicare premiums
- Consider long-term care insurance
- Budget $800-1,200/month per person

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Inflation

**The Impact:**
At 3% inflation, your purchasing power:
- Halves in 24 years
- Reduces to 1/3 in 37 years

**The Solution:**
- Use real return calculations
- Plan for 2-3% annual inflation
- Adjust retirement income annually
- Keep some stock exposure

### Mistake 3: Planning to Retire Too Early

**The Challenge:**
Retiring at 60 vs. 67 means:
- 7 fewer years of saving
- 7 more years of withdrawals
- Reduced Social Security benefits
- 33% longer retirement to fund

**The Math:**
- Retire at 60: Need 35-40x expenses
- Retire at 67: Need 25-30x expenses
- Working 7 more years can double retirement savings

### Mistake 4: Not Coordinating with Spouse

**Common Issues:**
- Different retirement age goals
- Mismatched spending expectations
- Unclear income sources
- No survivor plan

**The Solution:**
- Joint retirement planning sessions
- Agree on retirement age and lifestyle
- Calculate both pensions/Social Security
- Plan for survivor income needs
