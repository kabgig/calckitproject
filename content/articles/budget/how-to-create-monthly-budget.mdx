## Common Budgeting Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Being Too Restrictive

**The Problem:**
Creating an unrealistically tight budget that allows no flexibility leads to frustration and eventual abandonment.

**The Solution:**
- Build in "fun money" category
- Allow for occasional splurges
- Include miscellaneous buffer (5%)
- Make gradual spending reductions

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Irregular Expenses

**The Problem:**
Not accounting for quarterly, semi-annual, or annual expenses creates budget emergencies.

**The Solution:**
- List all irregular expenses
- Divide annual costs by 12
- Save monthly amount in sinking funds
- Examples: car insurance, property taxes, gifts

### Mistake 3: Not Tracking Small Purchases

**The Problem:**
Coffee, snacks, apps, and small purchases add up to hundreds per month.

**The Solution:**
- Track every purchase for 30 days
- Identify "spending leaks"
- Decide which small expenses to eliminate
- Build reasonable amount into budget

### Mistake 4: Comparing to Others

**The Problem:**
Trying to match friends' or social media lifestyles leads to overspending.

**The Solution:**
- Focus on YOUR financial goals
- Remember social media shows highlights
- Set boundaries on social spending
- Choose lower-cost social activities

### Mistake 5: Not Having Emergency Buffer

**The Problem:**
Budget has zero margin for unexpected expenses, forcing debt use.

**The Solution:**
- Build $1,000 starter emergency fund

- Keep buffer in savings account

**Example:**
$1,000 raise = $500 to savings, $300 to upgrades, $200 to debt

### When Income Decreases

**Priority Adjustments:**
1. Cut wants first
2. Reduce variable expenses
3. Negotiate fixed expenses
4. Consider temporary work

**Emergency Measures:**
- Pause retirement contributions temporarily
- Eliminate subscriptions
- Reduce insurance coverage strategically
- Seek additional income sources
