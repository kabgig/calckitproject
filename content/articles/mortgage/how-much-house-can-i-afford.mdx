# How Much House Can I Afford? 28/36 Rule Calculator & Income Guide 2026

"How much house can I afford?" is the **first question** every homebuyer should ask – but most people skip it and jump straight to browsing listings. This universal mistake leads to heartbreak: falling in love with homes you can't afford, stretching your budget to the breaking point, or worse, foreclosure.

This comprehensive guide shows you **exactly** how much house you can afford based on your income, debts, and down payment using the 28/36 rule that lenders use. You'll learn multiple affordability methods, see real examples across different income levels, and avoid the common affordability mistakes that lead to financial stress.

## The 28/36 Affordability Rule Explained

Lenders use the **28/36 rule** (also called the "conforming loan rule") to determine how much they'll lend you:

### The 28% Rule (Front-End Ratio)
**Your total housing costs should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income.**

**Housing costs (PITI) include:**
- Principal
- Interest
- Property Taxes
- Insurance (homeowners + PMI if applicable)

**Formula**: (Annual Gross Income × 0.28) ÷ 12 = Maximum Monthly PITI

**Example**: $80,000 annual income
- Maximum PITI: ($80,000 × 0.28) ÷ 12 = **$1,867/month**

### The 36% Rule (Back-End Ratio)
**Your total monthly debts including housing should not exceed 36% of gross monthly income.**

**Total debts include:**
- PITI (housing)
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Credit card minimum payments
- Personal loans
- Child support/alimony

**Formula**: (Annual Gross Income × 0.36) ÷ 12 = Maximum Total Monthly Debt

**Example**: $80,000 annual income
- Maximum total debt: ($80,000 × 0.36) ÷ 12 = **$2,400/month**
- Existing debts: $500/month (car + student loan)
- Maximum PITI: $2,400 - $500 = **$1,900/month**

### Which Rule is More Restrictive?

**You must satisfy BOTH rules** – whichever gives you the lower maximum payment.

**Example**: $80,000 income, $500 existing debts
- 28% rule: $1,867 max PITI ✓
- 36% rule: $1,900 max PITI ✓
- **Your limit**: $1,867 (the 28% rule is more restrictive)

**Example 2**: $80,000 income, $1,200 existing debts (higher debt)
- 28% rule: $1,867 max PITI ✓
- 36% rule: $1,200 max PITI ⚠️
- **Your limit**: $1,200 (the 36% rule is more restrictive due to high existing debt)

**Key insight**: High debts dramatically reduce your home affordability even with good income.

## How to Calculate Maximum Home Price From Income

Let's walk through the complete calculation step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Maximum Monthly PITI

**Using 28/36 rule**:

**Your scenario**:
- Gross annual income: $90,000
- Gross monthly income: $7,500
- Existing monthly debts: $600 (car loan + credit card)

**28% rule**: $7,500 × 0.28 = $2,100 max PITI
**36% rule**: ($7,500 × 0.36) - $600 = $2,700 - $600 = $2,100 max PITI

**Your maximum PITI**: $2,100/month (both rules give same result)

### Step 2: Estimate Property Tax & Insurance Percentage

**Property taxes** and **insurance** vary by location, but you can estimate:

**Conservative estimate**: Taxes + Insurance = 25% of total PITI
- In low-tax states: ~20%
- In moderate-tax states: ~25%
- In high-tax states (NJ, TX, IL): ~30-35%

**Example**: $2,100 max PITI, assume 25% goes to taxes+insurance
- Available for P&I: $2,100 × 0.75 = **$1,575/month**

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Loan Amount

**Use mortgage payment formula** or our calculator:

**Assumptions**:
- Monthly P&I: $1,575
- Interest rate: 7% (current market)
- Term: 30 years

**Maximum loan amount**: **$236,300**

**How to calculate**: Loan Amount = Monthly P&I × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]
- r = monthly interest rate (0.07/12 = 0.00583)
- n = number of payments (360)

Or use our [Mortgage Calculator](/calculators/mortgage) in reverse (enter payment, get loan amount).

### Step 4: Add Down Payment

**With different down payments**:

**5% down** (FHA minimum):
- Loan: $236,300
- Down payment: $236,300 ÷ 0.95 = $12,437
- **Max home price: $248,737** → Round to **$250,000**

**10% down**:
- Loan: $236,300
- Down payment: $236,300 ÷ 0.90 = $26,256
- **Max home price: $262,556** → Round to **$265,000**

**20% down** (no PMI):
- Loan: $236,300
- Down payment: $59,075
- **Max home price: $295,375** → Round to **$295,000**

**Key insight**: Larger down payment lets you afford a more expensive home with the same monthly payment.

### Step 5: Verify with PITI

**Check that PITI doesn't exceed $2,100**:

**Example**: $265,000 home, 10% down, 7% rate
- Loan: $238,500
- Monthly P&I: $1,588
- Property tax (1.2%): $265
- Insurance: $120
- PMI (0.5%): $99
- **Total PITI: $2,072** ✓ (under $2,100 limit)

## Real Examples: How Much House Can You Afford?

### Example 1: $50,000 Income (Entry-Level Buyer)

**Income details**:
- Annual gross: $50,000
- Monthly gross: $4,167
- Existing debts: $350 (car loan)
- Down payment saved: $10,000 (10%)

**28/36 calculation**:
- 28% rule: $4,167 × 0.28 = $1,167 max PITI
- 36% rule: ($4,167 × 0.36) - $350 = $1,150 max PITI
- **Limit**: $1,150/month

**Home affordability**:
- Estimated tax+insurance: 25% of PITI = $288
- Available for P&I: $862
- Loan amount at 7%: **$129,000**
- With $10,000 down (10%): **Max price ~$143,000**

**Reality check**: In expensive markets (CA, NY, Seattle), $143K doesn't exist. Options:
- Increase income (get roommate, side hustle)
- Eliminate car debt ($350/month freed up = $52K more buying power)
- Save larger down payment
- Consider lower cost-of-living area

### Example 2: $75,000 Income (Median Single Buyer)

**Income details**:
- Annual gross: $75,000
- Monthly gross: $6,250
- Existing debts: $500 (student loans + car)
- Down payment saved: $30,000 (15%)

**28/36 calculation**:
- 28% rule: $6,250 × 0.28 = $1,750 max PITI
- 36% rule: ($6,250 × 0.36) - $500 = $1,750 max PITI
- **Limit**: $1,750/month

**Home affordability**:
- Estimated tax+insurance: $438
- Available for P&I: $1,312
- Loan amount at 7%: **$196,500**
- With $30,000 down (15%): **Max price ~$231,000**

**Markets where this works**:
- ✓ Most of Midwest (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Indianapolis)
- ✓ Parts of South (Houston suburbs, Atlanta suburbs)
- ✗ Coastal California, Seattle, Boston, NYC
- ✗ Austin, Denver, Portland

### Example 3: $100,000 Income (Comfortable Single Buyer)

**Income details**:
- Annual gross: $100,000
- Monthly gross: $8,333
- Existing debts: $700 (car + student loans)
- Down payment saved: $50,000 (15%)

**28/36 calculation**:
- 28% rule: $8,333 × 0.28 = $2,333 max PITI
- 36% rule: ($8,333 × 0.36) - $700 = $2,300 max PITI
- **Limit**: $2,300/month (36% rule more restrictive)

**Home affordability**:
- Estimated tax+insurance: $575
- Available for P&I: $1,725
- Loan amount at 7%: **$258,300**
- With $50,000 down (15%): **Max price ~$304,000**

**If debt-free** (no car/student loans):
- 28% rule: $2,333 max PITI (same)
- 36% rule: $3,000 max PITI
- **New limit**: $2,333 (28% rule now binding)
- Estimated P&I: $1,750
- Loan amount: **$262,000**
- With $50,000 down: **Max price ~$312,000**

**Key insight**: Eliminating $700 debt only increased buying power by $8K. At high incomes, debt payoff has less impact than at low incomes because the 28% rule (not 36%) becomes the constraint.

### Example 4: $150,000 Household Income (Dual Income)

**Income details**:
- Annual gross: $150,000 (both incomes combined)
- Monthly gross: $12,500
- Existing debts: $900 (two cars)
- Down payment saved: $100,000 (20%)

**28/36 calculation**:
- 28% rule: $12,500 × 0.28 = $3,500 max PITI
- 36% rule: ($12,500 × 0.36) - $900 = $3,600 max PITI
- **Limit**: $3,500/month

**Home affordability**:
- Estimated tax+insurance: $875 (25%)
- Available for P&I: $2,625
- Loan amount at 7%: **$393,000**
- With $100,000 down (20%): **Max price ~$493,000**

**This budget works in:**
- ✓ Most major metros (suburbs of Denver, Seattle, Austin, San Diego)
- ✓ Excellent homes in lower-cost areas
- ✗ San Francisco, Manhattan, parts of LA (need $800K+)

### Example 5: $250,000 Household Income (High Earners)

**Income details**:
- Annual gross: $250,000
- Monthly gross: $20,833
- Existing debts: $1,200 (luxury car leases)
- Down payment saved: $200,000 (20%)

**28/36 calculation**:
- 28% rule: $20,833 × 0.28 = $5,833 max PITI
- 36% rule: ($20,833 × 0.36) - $1,200 = $6,300 max PITI
- **Limit**: $5,833/month

**Home affordability**:
- Estimated tax+insurance: $1,458
- Available for P&I: $4,375
- Loan amount at 7%: **$654,900**
- With $200,000 down (20%): **Max price ~$855,000**

**Buying power at this income**:
- ✓ Luxury homes in most cities
- ✓ Decent starter home in San Francisco/Manhattan
- ✗ Premium neighborhoods in most expensive zips

## Alternative Affordability Methods

While 28/36 is the **lender's** standard, you might want to use different methods:

### Conservative 25% Rule (Our Recommendation)

**Keep housing at 25% of gross income** for comfortable budgeting.

**Why**: Leaves room for:
- Emergency savings (1% of home value annually)
- Retirement investing (15% of income)
- Kids' education savings
- Vacations and quality of life
- Job loss buffer

**Example**: $100,000 income
- 28% rule (lender): $2,333 PITI → $312K home
- **25% rule (ours)**: $2,083 PITI → $280K home
- Safety buffer: $32K lower price = less stress

### The 3x Gross Income Quick Rule

**Maximum home price = 3x your gross annual income**

**Examples**:
- $60,000 income → Max $180,000 home
- $100,000 income → Max $300,000 home
- $200,000 income → Max $600,000 home

**Pros**: Very simple, quick estimate
**Cons**: Doesn't account for down payment size, interest rates, property taxes, existing debts

**When this works**: 20% down, 7% rate, moderate property taxes. In high-tax states or with small down payment, this overestimates affordability.

### The 4-5x Gross Income Aggressive Rule

Some high earners use **4-5x income** when:
- Very stable dual income
- Low or zero existing debts
- Large down payment (30%+)
- Low property taxes
- High income but frugal lifestyle

**Example**: $200K income × 5 = $1M home
- 28/36 rule would suggest $750K-$850K
- **Risk**: One income loss could make payments unaffordable

**Our take**: Only stretch to 4-5x if you have 6+ months emergency fund and minimal other debts.

### The 50/30/20 Budget Rule Applied to Housing

**Budget philosophy**: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings

**Housing calculation**:
- 50% of gross income for **all needs** (housing, utilities, food, transport, insurance)
- If housing is 28%, you have 22% left for all other needs
- **Example**: $8,000/month income
  - Housing: $2,240 (28%)
  - Other needs: $1,760 (22%)
  - Wants: $2,400 (30%)
  - Savings: $1,600 (20%)

**Reality check**: In high-cost cities, housing alone can be 35-40% of income, leaving little for other needs. This forces cutting savings or wants.

## What Lenders Don't Tell You About Affordability

### Reality 1: Maximum Approval ≠ Comfortable Payment

**Lenders qualify you for the maximum** they can legally lend. This is often **more than you should borrow**.

**Example**: $120K income
- Lender approves: $3,360/month PITI (28%)
- Affordable home: ~$440K
- **Comfortable payment**: $2,500 PITI (25%)  
- **Comfortable home**: $330K

**The $110K difference** is the margin between "approved" and "comfortable." Choose comfort.

### Reality 2: They Don't Account for Lifestyle

**Lenders don't ask**:
- Do you eat out 3x/week? ($500/month)
- Do you have expensive hobbies? ($300/month)
- Are you funding 401(k)? ($833/month for 10% of $100K)
- Do you want to travel? ($400/month saving)

**Example**: $100K income, $700/month "lifestyle" spending
- Lender sees: $8,333 gross income, approves $2,333 PITI
- **Your reality**: $2,333 PITI + $700 lifestyle = $3,033 total
- Remaining for food, utilities, transport, etc.: $5,300

**After accounting for everything**: You realize $1,800 PITI is more realistic (23% instead of 28%)

### Reality 3: Interest Rate Swings Change Everything

**At 6% vs. 8%, affordability shifts dramatically**:

**Example**: $2,000/month P&I budget, 30-year loan
- **At 6% rate**: Can borrow $333,600
- **At 7% rate**: Can borrow $299,700
- **At 8% rate**: Can borrow $272,500

**With 20% down**:
- At 6%: Max home $417K  
- At 7%: Max home $375K
- At 8%: Max home $341K

**$76K swing** based purely on 2% rate change. When rates rise, you must target cheaper homes or save larger down payment to compensate.

### Reality 4: Property Taxes Vary 10x By Location

**Same income, wildly different affordability**:

**$100K income**: Max $2,333 PITI
- **Hawaii** (0.27% property tax): Max home $407K
- **California** (0.7% tax): Max home $360K
- **Texas** (1.7% tax): Max home $325K  
- **New Jersey** (2.2% tax): Max home $295K

**$112K swing** between Hawaii and New Jersey purely due to property taxes. Location matters enormously.

## How to Improve Your Home Affordability

### Strategy 1: Increase Down Payment

**Impact**: Every $10K down payment increases max home price by $10K while keeping same monthly payment.

**Example**: $2,000 PITI budget, 7% rate
- 5% down: Max home $282K (loan $268K)
- 10% down: Max home $295K (loan $266K)
- 20% down: Max home $330K (loan $264K)

**Bonus**: 20%+ down eliminates PMI (~$100-150/month savings), increasing buying power another $15-20K.

**Action**: Every $1 saved toward down payment = $1 more expensive home you can afford.

### Strategy 2: Eliminate Debts

**Impact**: Each $100/month debt eliminated increases buying power by $15-20K.

**Example**: $90K income, $800 monthly debts
- Current: 36% rule limits PITI to $1,900
- **If debt-free**: 28% rule limits PITI to $2,100 (+$200/month)
- Additional buying power: **$30,000**

**Best debts to pay off first**:
1. **High monthly payments** (car loans) – biggest impact
2. **Credit cards** – also improves credit score (lower rate)
3. **Student loans** – if payment is high relative to balance

**Use our** [Debt Payoff Calculator](/calculators/debt-payoff-planner) to optimize payoff strategy.

### Strategy 3: Improve Credit Score

**Impact**: Each 20-point credit score increase saves ~0.25% on interest rate.

**Example**: $300K loan, 30 years
- 660 score: 7.5% rate = $2,098/month
- 720 score: 7.0% rate = $1,996/month
- **Savings**: $102/month = $36,720 over life of loan

**With same PITI budget**: The $102 savings on payment can be redirected to afford a $15K more expensive home.

**Credit improvement tactics**:
- Pay down credit cards below 30% utilization (instant impact)
- Dispute errors on credit report
- Don't close old credit cards (hurts average age)
- Make all payments on time for 6-12 months before applying

### Strategy 4: Increase Income

**Impact**: Most direct path to higher affordability.

**28% of income** goes to housing, so:
- $10K raise → $2,800/year → $233/month additional PITI → +$35K buying power
- $20K raise → +$70K buying power
- $30K raise → +$105K buying power

**Income boost options**:
- **Negotiate raise**: 5% raise on $80K = $4K/year = $10K more buying power
- **Job switch**: Average 10-20% pay increase = $20-40K more buying power
- **Side income**: $500/month side hustle (if stable) = $25K more buying power
- **Include partner's income**: Dual income dramatically increases buying power

**Lender requirements for income**:
- W-2 income: Must show 2 years history (can use immediately)
- Self-employment: Must show 2 years of tax returns (averaged)
- Side income: Needs 2-year history to count

### Strategy 5: Consider Different Loan Products

**FHA Loans** (low down payment):
- Down payment: 3.5%
- Max debt ratio: 43% (vs 36% conventional)
- **Trade-off**: Permanent mortgage insurance (0.85% of loan annually)

**VA Loans** (veterans):
- Down payment: 0%
- No PMI ever
- Looser debt ratios
- **Best deal** if you qualify

**USDA Loans** (rural areas):
- Down payment: 0%
- Income limits apply
- Must be in designated rural area
- **Great option** for qualifying locations

**Example**: $100K income, $1,000 debts
- Conventional 28/36: Max $1,300 PITI → $190K home
- FHA 43%: Max $2,583 PITI → $370K home
- **Difference**: $180K more buying power with FHA

**Warning**: Just because you can qualify for more doesn't mean you should borrow more. Higher debt ratios mean tighter monthly budgets.

## Common Home Affordability Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Maxing Out Your Approval

**The trap**: Bank approves you for $400K, so you shop for $400K homes.

**The problem**: No buffer for:
- Home repairs ($3K water heater dies)
- Property tax increases
- Income disruption
- Lifestyle changes (kids, career shift)

**The fix**: Max approval - 15% = Comfortable price
- Approved for $400K → Shop at $340K
- Creates $60K safety buffer

### Mistake 2: Not Accounting for All Housing Costs

**The trap**: Seeing "P&I payment: $1,800" and budgeting $1,800 for housing.

**The problem**: Total monthly housing cost is:
- PITI: $2,400 (not just $1,800 P&I)
- HOA: $250
- Utilities: $300
- Maintenance fund: $250
- **Total: $3,200** (78% more than P&I alone!)

**The fix**: Budget for **total housing costs**, not just P&I or even just PITI. See our comprehensive PITI guide.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Job Security

**The trap**: Taking on maximum payment with unstable income.

**Scenarios**:
- Commission-based sales (income varies)
- Tech worker (layoff risk)
- Contract worker (gaps between contracts)
- Small business owner (revenue varies)

**The fix**: 
- Use lowest 12-month income for calculations
- Keep 6-12 months expenses in emergency fund
- Consider cheaper home for peace of mind

**Example**: $150K typical income, but had one $90K year recently
- Qualify using $150K → risky
- Qualify using $120K (average of both) → safer
- If laid off and take 6 months to find new job at $100K, can you afford payment?

### Mistake 4: Buying Based on Dual Income Without Job Protection

**The trap**: Household income $150K ($80K + $70K), buy $500K home.

**The scenarios**:
- One partner loses job → household income drops to $70-80K
- One partner takes parental leave (unpaid or reduced pay)
- One partner goes back to school
- Divorce (now two households to support)

**The test**: Can you afford the payment on **one income**?
- $150K combined: Max PITI $3,500
- **$80K single**: Max PITI $1,867
- **If you can't afford on one income**, you're overextended

**The fix**: Keep housing at 20% of combined income instead of 28%, or ensure one income fully covers PITI.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting About Closing Costs and Moving Expenses

**The trap**: Saving exactly 20% down payment ($60K for $300K home), nothing more.

**The problem**:
- Closing costs: 2-5% of home price = $6K-$15K
- Moving costs: $1K-$3K
- Immediate repairs: $2K-$5K (inspection finds issues)
- New furniture/appliances: $3K-$10K
- **Total**: $12K-$33K on top of down payment

**The fix**: Save 22-25% of home price total (down payment + closing costs + moving buffer)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I use gross income or net income for affordability calculations?**

A: **Gross income** (before taxes). Lenders always use gross income for the 28/36 rule. This means your take-home pay is less than what the calculation assumes, which is why 28% of gross often feels like 35-40% of take-home.

**Q: Do lenders count my partner's income if we're not married?**

A: Yes, if you both will be on the mortgage. The lender considers total household income of all borrowers. **Caution**: Both names on mortgage = both are legally responsible even if you split up.

**Q: What if I'm self-employed or have variable income?**

A: Lenders average your income over the past **2 years** of tax returns. If you had $80K in Year 1 and $120K in Year 2, they use $100K. Bring 2 years of complete tax returns when applying.

**Q: Can I use rental income from the home I'm buying?**

A: If you're buying a 2-4 unit property and living in one unit, yes. Lenders count 75% of projected rental income. **Example**: Duplex, other unit rents for $1,500/month → Lender adds $1,125/month to your income.

**Q: Does student loan forbearance count against my debt ratio?**

A: Since 2021 rules, yes. Even if you're not currently making payments due to forbearance, lenders calculate a payment (usually 0.5-1% of balance monthly) and count it as debt. **Example**: $50K student loan balance = $250-500/month counted even if you pay $0 currently.

**Q: How often should I recalculate what I can afford?**

A: Recalculate when:
- Income changes (raise, job loss, new job)
- Debts change (paid off car, new loan)
- Interest rates change 0.5%+ from previous calculation
- Saved more down payment (+$10K+)
- Changed target markets (different property tax rates)

## Conclusion: Know Your Number Before House Hunting

The single most important number in your home buying journey is **how much house you can actually afford** – not what Zillow says you can browse, not what your lender approves you for, but what you can comfortably pay every month while still saving, investing, and enjoying life.

**Your action plan:**
1. **Calculate your max using 28/36 rule** with our [Home Affordability Calculator](/calculators/home-affordability)
