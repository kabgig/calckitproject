## Net Worth Formula

### Simple Definition

**Net worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities**

In plain English: Everything you own minus everything you owe.

**Formula:**
```
Net Worth = (Cash + Investments + Property + Other Assets) - (Debts + Loans + Other Liabilities)
```

### Example Overview

**Assets:**
- Checking account: $5,000
- Savings account: $20,000
- 401(k): $75,000
- Home: $350,000
- Cars: $30,000
**Total Assets: $480,000**

**Liabilities:**
- Mortgage: $250,000
- Car loan: $18,000
- Student loans: $25,000
- Credit cards: $3,000
**Total Liabilities: $296,000**

**Net Worth: $480,000 - $296,000 = $184,000**

### Positive vs. Negative Net Worth

**Positive Net Worth:**
Assets exceed liabilities—you're building wealth.

Example: Assets $300,000, Liabilities $180,000 = +$120,000 net worth

**Negative Net Worth:**
Liabilities exceed assets—you owe more than you own.

Example: Assets $45,000, Liabilities $75,000 = -$30,000 net worth

**Common for:**
- Recent graduates with student loans
- Young professionals early in career
- Anyone with significant debt
- Not permanent—reversible with strategy

### Why Net Worth Matters

**Better than Income:**
- $200K income, $500K debt = Poor financial health
- $60K income, $300K net worth = Strong financial health

**Measures Actual Wealth:**
- Shows results of financial decisions
- Accounts for debt burden
- Reveals true financial progress
- Can be grown intentionally

**Goal Setting:**
- Specific target to work toward
- Track progress over time
- Motivates wealth-building behaviors
- Helps prioritize financial decisions

**Median (50th Percentile):**
Middle value when all are sorted
Better representation of "typical"

**Always compare to median for realistic benchmark.**

### US Household Net Worth by Age (2024 Data)

| Age Group | Median Net Worth | Average Net Worth |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Under 35 | $39,000 | $183,000 |

### Expected Net Worth by Age Formula

**Thomas Stanley's Formula:**

```
Expected Net Worth = (Age - 25) × (Gross Income / 5)
```

**Example:**
- Age: 40
- Income: $85,000

Expected = (40 - 25) × ($85,000 / 5)
= 15 × $17,000
= **$255,000**

**Categories:**
- **Under-accumulator:** Net worth less than 50% of expected

### Setting Net Worth Goals

**SMART Goals:**

❌ **Vague:** "Increase net worth"

✓ **SMART:** "Increase net worth from $180,000 to $220,000 by December 31, 2026" 
- Specific: $220,000 target
- Measurable: Track monthly
- Achievable: $40,000 increase ($3,333/month)
- Relevant: Toward financial independence
- Time-bound: December 31, 2026

**Milestone Goals:**

- $0: Debt-free, break even
- $100K: First six figures
- $250K: Quarter million
- $500K: Half millionaire
- $1M: Millionaire status
- $2M: Multi-millionaire

## Common Net Worth Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Including Home at Purchase Price

**The Error:**
Using what you paid, not current value.

**Example:**
- Bought home in 2020: $300,000
- Current value 2026: $375,000
- Using $300,000: **Understates net worth by $75,000**

**Correct:** Always use current market value.

### Mistake 2: Forgetting About Taxes

**The Issue:**
Pre-tax accounts will be taxed on withdrawal.

**Example:**
401(k) balance: $300,000

**After taxes (24% bracket):**
Real value: $300,000 × 0.76 = $228,000

**Solution:**
- Either include tax-adjusted values
- Or use pre-tax consistently
- Be clear which method you use

**Most people:** Use pre-tax for simplicity

### Mistake 3: Counting Cars at Purchase Price

**The Error:**
Cars depreciate rapidly.

**Example:**
- Bought car for $35,000 (2023)
- Current value: $22,000 (2026)
- Using $35,000: **Overstates by $13,000**

**Correct:** Use KBB private party value.

### Mistake 4: Not Including All Accounts

**Common Omissions:**
- Old 401(k) from previous employer
- Forgotten savings accounts
- HSA balance
- 529 plans
- Cryptocurrency

**Solution:** Annual audit of all financial accounts.

### Mistake 5: Comparing  to the Wrong Benchmark

**The Error:**
Comparing to average instead of median.

**Reality:**
- Average is skewed by ultra-wealthy
- Median represents typical household
- Always compare to median

**Also consider:**
- Income level (high earners should have higher NW)
- Cost of living area
- Family situation
- Career stage

### Mistake 6: Getting Discouraged by Negative Net Worth

**The Truth:**
Negative net worth is common early in career, especially with student loans.

**Example Path to Positive:**

Age 25: -$50,000 (student loans exceed assets)
Age 28: -$20,000 (paying down debt, building savings)
Age 30: $15,000 (crossed into positive!)
Age 35: $125,000 (aggressive growth phase)

**Key:** Focus on the trend (increasing), not absolute number.
