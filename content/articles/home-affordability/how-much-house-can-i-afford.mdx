# How Much House Can I Afford? Complete Home Affordability Guide 2026

Buying a home is likely the largest financial decision you'll make. While lenders may pre-approve you for a certain amount, that doesn't mean you should (or can comfortably) borrow that much.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn multiple methods to calculate your true home affordability, understand the 28/36 rule, account for hidden costs, and avoid becoming house poor.

## The 28/36 Rule Explained

The 28/36 rule is the mortgage industry's standard guideline for determining how much housing debt you can safely carry.

### The 28% Front-End Ratio

**Rule:** Your total housing payment should not exceed **28% of your gross monthly income**.

**Housing Payment Includes:**
- Principal and interest (P&I)
- Property taxes
- Homeowners insurance
- HOA fees (if applicable)
- Private mortgage insurance (PMI, if under 20% down)

**Formula:**
Maximum housing payment = Gross monthly income × 0.28

**Example:**
- Gross monthly income: $7,000
- Maximum housing payment: $7,000 × 0.28 = **$1,960/month**

### The 36% Back-End Ratio

**Rule:** Your total debt payments should not exceed **36% of your gross monthly income**.

**Total Debt Includes:**
- Housing payment (P&I, taxes, insurance, HOA)
- Credit card minimum payments
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Personal loans
- Other recurring debt

**Formula:**
Maximum total debt = Gross monthly income × 0.36

**Example:**
- Gross monthly income: $7,000
- Maximum total debt: $7,000 × 0.36 = **$2,520/month**
- Existing debt: $600/month
- Available for housing: $2,520 - $600 = **$1,920/month**

### Which Number Wins?

Always use the **lower number** when front-end and back-end ratios differ.

**Example:**
- Front-end (28%): $1,960
- Back-end (36% minus existing debt): $1,920
- **Use: $1,920** ✓ (more conservative)

## How Lenders Calculate Affordability

### Step 1: Calculate Your Gross Monthly Income

**W-2 Employees:**
- Annual salary ÷ 12
- Example: $90,000 ÷ 12 = $7,500/month

**Hourly Workers:**
- Hourly rate × hours per week × 52 weeks ÷ 12 months
- Example: $35/hour × 40 hours × 52 ÷ 12 = $6,067/month

**Self-Employed:**
- Average of last 2 years tax returns
- After deductions (AGI)
- Example: 2024 AGI $85,000 + 2025 AGI $95,000 = $90,000 average
- Monthly: $90,000 ÷ 12 = $7,500

**Additional Income (if documented):**
- Bonuses (2-year average)
- Commission (2-year average)
- Rental income (after expenses)
- Investment income
- Alimony/child support

### Step 2: Apply the 28% Rule

**Example:**
- Gross monthly income: $8,000
- Maximum housing payment: $8,000 × 0.28 = $2,240

### Step 3: Subtract Property Taxes and Insurance

**Typical Costs:**
- Property taxes: 1.1% of home value annually
- Homeowners insurance: $1,400-2,000/year
- HOA fees: Varies ($100-500/month)
- PMI (if under 20% down): 0.5-1% annually

**Example Calculation:**

Gross monthly income: $8,000
28% rule: $2,240/month maximum housing payment

**Estimated costs:**
- Property taxes: $250/month
- Insurance: $150/month
- HOA: $100/month
- PMI: $100/month
**Total non-mortgage: $600/month**

**Available for P&I:** $2,240 - $600 = $1,640/month

### Step 4: Calculate Maximum Loan Amount

Using mortgage calculator with 7% interest rate, 30-year term:
- Monthly P&I: $1,640
- Maximum loan: ~$246,000

**With 20% down:**
- Maximum loan: $246,000
- Down payment (20%): $61,500
- **Maximum home price: $307,500**

**With 10% down:**
- Maximum loan: $246,000  
- Down payment (10%): $27,333
- **Maximum home price: $273,333**

## Your True Affordability Number

Lender approval ≠ what you can comfortably afford.

### Conservative Affordability (Recommended)

**Use 25% instead of 28%**

**Why 25%?**
- Buffer for unexpected expenses
- Room for savings goals
- Lifestyle flexibility
- Financial stress reduction
- Easier to manage if income drops

**Example Comparison:**

Income: $7,000/month

**28% Rule:** $1,960 housing payment
**25% Rule:** $1,750 housing payment
**Difference:** $210/month ($2,520/year)

That $210 can go to:
- Additional retirement savings
- Emergency fund
- Home maintenance
- Debt payoff
- Quality of life

### Income-Based Purchase Price Guidelines

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Annual Income | 28% Rule Max | 25% Rule Max | Conservative Max |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| $50,000 | $153,000 | $137,000 | $125,000 |
| $75,000 | $230,000 | $206,000 | $187,500 |
| $100,000 | $307,000 | $275,000 | $250,000 |
| $125,000 | $383,000 | $343,000 | $312,500 |
| $150,000 | $460,000 | $412,000 | $375,000 |
| $200,000 | $613,000 | $549,000 | $500,000 |

*Assumes 7% interest, 20% down, 1.1% property tax, $1,500/year insurance*

### The 3x Income Rule of Thumb

**Conservative guideline:** Home price should not exceed **3x your gross annual income**.

**Example:**
- Annual income: $100,000
- **Maximum home price: $300,000**

**Adjustments:**
- Low interest rates: Up to 3.5x
- High cost of living area: Up to 4x (with caution)
- Low debt: Up to 3.5x
- Significant debt: Under 2.5x

## Hidden Homeownership Costs

### Beyond the Mortgage

Many first-time buyers focus only on the mortgage payment and get caught off-guard by total costs.

**True Monthly Costs:**

**1. Principal & Interest (P&I)**
The mortgage payment everyone focuses on.

Target: $60,000 (20% of $300,000)

**Aggressive savings:**
- Monthly: $1,000
- Time: 60 months (5 years)
- In HYSA at 4.5%: $66,850

**Moderate savings:**
- Monthly: $600
- Time: 100 months (8.3 years)
- In HYSA at 4.5%: $73,500

**Alternative Sources:**
- First-time buyer programs
- Down payment assistance
- Gift from family
- 401(k) loan (not recommended)
- Roth IRA contributions (up to $10,000 first-time buyer)

## Special Considerations

### Dual-Income Couples

**Strategy 1: Use Lower Income Only**
More conservative, protects against job loss.

**Example:**
- Spouse 1: $80,000/year
- Spouse 2: $60,000/year
- Use only: $60,000
- **Max home: $180,000-240,000**

**Strategy 2: Use Combined with Buffer**
Use both incomes but buy below max.

- Combined: $140,000/year
- 28% rule max: $430,000
- But buy: $350,000 (safety buffer)

### High-Debt Situations

**If you have significant debt:**
- Pay off first before buying
- Or buy significantly under max
- Focus on 36% back-end ratio

**Example:**
Income: $100,000/year ($8,333/month)
Existing debt: $1,200/month

**28% front-end:** $2,333 max housing
**36% back-end:** $3,000 total - $1,200 debt = $1,800 housing
**Use: $1,800** (more restrictive)

**Better approach:**
Pay off $600/month debt first:
- New back-end limit: $2,400 housing
- Significant increase in affordability

### Self-Employed Buyers

**Challenges:**
- Income verification harder
- Need 2 years tax returns
- Lenders use after-deduction income (AGI)

**Tips:**
- Minimize business deductions 2 years before buying
- Maintain consistent income
- Strong credit score (720+)
- Larger down payment (20%+)
- Keep business/personal finances separate

**Example:**

Gross business income: $150,000
After deductions: $85,000 AGI
Lender uses: $85,000

Max home (3x): $255,000
(vs. $450,000 if they used gross income)

### High Cost of Living Areas

In expensive markets (SF, NYC, LA, Seattle), traditional ratios don't always work.

**Adjustments:**
- May go to 35-40% front-end ratio
- But requires:
  - Minimal other debt
  - Strong income
  - Large emergency fund (12+ months)
  - High credit score

**Reality:**
Even with adjustments, many are priced out of homeownership in HCOL areas.

**Alternatives:**
- Rent longer, save more
- Consider lower-cost neighborhoods
- Smaller home/condo
- Relocate to lower-cost area

## Common Home Buying Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Maxing Out the Pre-Approval

**The Problem:**
Lenders approve you for the maximum you *can* pay, not what you *should* pay.

**The Reality:**
- Lenders want you to borrow more (more interest)
- You know your lifestyle needs better than they do
- Unexpected expenses happen

**The Solution:**
Set your own limit at 80-90% of pre-approval amount.

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Property Taxes

**The Problem:**
Focusing only on mortgage payment, forgetting taxes can be $500-800+/month.

**The Reality:**
$300,000 home:
- Mortgage: $1,600/month
- Taxes: $550/month
- Insurance: $150/month
- **Total: $2,300/month** (45% more than mortgage alone)

**The Solution:**
Always calculate PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance) as your true payment.

### Mistake 3: House Poor Syndrome

**The Problem:**
Spending so much on housing that there's nothing left for life, savings, or emergencies.

**Signs You're House Poor:**
- Can't save for emergencies
- No money for retirement
- Stressed about every expense
- Can't afford home maintenance
- No budget for fun or travel
- One paycheck from disaster

**The Solution:**
Buy below your maximum, maintain 15-20% savings rate, keep emergency fund.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Future Plans

**The Problem:**
Buying without considering 5-year lifestyle changes.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Will you have children?
- Will income change?
- Might you change careers?
- Want to travel more?
- Need to support aging parents?
- Considering graduate school?

**The Solution:**
Build flexibility into your budget. Don't max out based on current situation.

## Real Affordability Examples

### Example 1: Single Buyer, Moderate Income

**Profile:**
- Income: $65,000/year ($5,417/month)
- Current rent: $1,200/month
- Existing debt: $350/month (car + student loans)
- Credit score: 720
- Saved for down payment: $25,000

**Affordability Calculation:**

**28% front-end:**
$5,417 × 0.28 = $1,517/month

**36% back-end:**
$5,417 × 0.36 = $1,950 total - $350 debt = $1,600/month

**Limiting factor: $1,517/month** (front-end)

**Breakdown:**
- PITI: $1,517
- Taxes/Insurance/HOA: -$400
- **Available P&I: $1,117**

**With 7% rate, 30 years:**
- Maximum loan: ~$168,000

**Purchase prices by down payment:**
- 20% down: $210,000 home
- 10% down: $187,000 home
- 5% down: $177,000 home

**Recommendation:** 
Target $180,000-200,000 homes with 10-15% down. Maintain emergency fund.

### Example 2: Couple, Strong Income, High Debt

**Profile:**
- Combined income: $140,000/year ($11,667/month)
- Existing debt: $2,100/month
  - Car 1: $550
  - Car 2: $600
  - Student loans: $850
  - Credit cards: $100
- Credit scores: 740/720
- Saved: $45,000

**Affordability Calculation:**

**28% front-end:**
$11,667 × 0.28 = $3,267

**36% back-end:**
$11,667 × 0.36 = $4,200 - $2,100 debt = $2,100

**Limiting factor: $2,100/month** (back-end)

**Big problem:** Debt consuming $2,100/month reduces home buying power significantly!

**Option 1: Buy Now**
- Max housing: $2,100
- Taxes/Insurance: -$450
- P&I: $1,650
- Max loan: ~$247,000
- With 15% down: $290,000 home

**Option 2: Pay Off Debt First** (Recommended)
- Pay off cars (18 months aggressive)
- Now debt: $950/month
- New back-end: $3,250 housing
- P&I available: $2,800
- Max loan: ~$420,000
- With 20% down: $525,000 home

**Recommendation:**
Delay purchase 18 months, aggressively pay off cars, then buy. Gain $235,000 in buying power!

### Example 3: High Earner, Expensive Market

**Profile:**
- Income: $200,000/year ($16,667/month)
- Location: High cost area (SF Bay Area)
- Minimal debt: $200/month
- Credit score: 780
- Saved: $150,000

**Standard Calculation:**

**28% front-end:**
$16,667 × 0.28 = $4,667

**In expensive market, may stretch to 35%:**
$16,667 × 0.35 = $5,833

**Breakdown:**
- Total: $5,833
- Taxes (high in CA): -$1,200
- Insurance: -$200
- HOA: -$400
- **P&I: $4,033**

**7% rate, 30 years:**
Maximum loan: ~$605,000

**With 20% down ($151,250):**
**Maximum home: $756,250**

**Reality in SF:**
- Median home price: $1.2M
- Still can't afford median
- Would need 40% of income (very risky)

**Recommendation:**
- Target $700,000-800,000
- Consider condo vs. single-family
- Or rent and invest until earning more
- Or relocate to lower-cost area

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Use 28/36 rule as starting point**: 28% front-end, 36% back-end

✓ **Calculate your true number**: Consider all costs, not just mortgage

✓ **Be conservative**: Use 25% rule instead of 28% for safety buffer

✓ **Include hidden costs**: Taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities

✓ **Pay down debt first**: Dramatically increases buying power

✓ **Save 20% down**: Eliminates PMI, lowers payment, saves thousands

✓ **Don't max out approval**: Lenders approve maximum, not comfortable

✓ **Leave room for life**: Don't become house poor

## Conclusion

Determining how much house you can afford isn't just about what a lender will approve—it's about what fits comfortably in your overall financial plan. Use the 28/36 rule as a starting point, but consider your complete financial picture, lifestyle goals, and the true costs of homeownership.

Being conservative with your home purchase leaves room for emergency savings, retirement contributions, travel, and quality of life. It's better to buy less house and have financial flexibility than to stretch to the maximum and be stressed about money constantly.
