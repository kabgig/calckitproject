## Understanding the US Tax System

### Progressive Tax System

The United States uses a **progressive tax system**, meaning higher income is taxed at higher rates.

**Key concept:** You don't pay your top tax rate on all income—only on income within each bracket.

**Example:**
If you're in the 22% bracket, you DON'T pay 22% on all income. You pay:
- 10% on the first portion
- 12% on the next portion
- 22% only on income in that bracket

### How Tax Brackets Work

**Think of it like filling buckets:**

Each tax bracket is a bucket. Lower buckets fill first. Only overflow goes to next bucket.

**Visual Example ($100,000 Single Filer):**

| Bucket (Bracket) | Range | Tax Rate | Income in Bucket | Tax on Bucket |
|------------------|-------|----------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 | $0-$11,600 | 10% | $11,600 | $1,160 |
| 2 | $11,601-$47,150 | 12% | $35,550 | $4,266 |
| 3 | $47,151-$100,525 | 22% | $52,850 | $11,627 |
| **Total** | | | **$100,000** | **$17,053** |

**Effective tax rate:** $17,053 ÷ $100,000 = **17.05%** (even though marginal rate is 22%)

### Important Terms

**Gross Income:**
Total income before any deductions ($100,000 salary = $100,000 gross income)

**Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):**
Gross income minus "above-the-line" deductions (401k, HSA, student loan interest, etc.)

**Taxable Income:**
AGI minus standard or itemized deductions (this is what you actually pay tax on)

**Tax Liability:**
Total federal income tax owed before credits

**Tax Owed/Refund:**
Tax liability minus withholdings and credits

## Calculating Taxable Income

### Step 1: Start with Gross Income

**Include all income sources:**

✓ **Wages and Salaries**
- W-2 income from employment
- Bonuses, commissions
- Tips

✓ **Self-Employment Income**
- 1099 income
- Business profits
- Freelance earnings

✓ **Investment Income**
- Interest (savings, bonds)
- Dividends
- Capital gains
- Rental income

✓ **Retirement Income**
- 401(k)/IRA withdrawals (traditional, not Roth)
- Pension payments
- Social Security (portion taxable depending on income)

✓ **Other Income**
- Unemployment benefits
- Alimony (if divorce before 2019)
- Gambling winnings
- Prizes and awards

**Example Gross Income:**
- Salary: $85,000
- Bank interest: $200
- Stock dividends: $1,500
**Total Gross: $86,700**

### Step 2: Calculate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

Subtract "above-the-line" deductions:

**Common Above-the-Line Deductions:**

✓ **Retirement Contributions**
- Traditional 401(k): Up to $23,500 (2026)
- Traditional IRA: Up to $7,000 (2026)
- SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA

✓ **Health Savings Account (HSA)**
- Individual: Up to $4,300 (2026)
- Family: Up to $8,550 (2026)

✓ **Student Loan Interest**
- Up to $2,500 deduction
- Phases out at higher incomes

✓ **Self-Employment Tax (Half)**
- If self-employed, deduct 50% of SE tax

✓ **Other Deductions**
- Educator expenses ($300)
- Moving expenses (military only)
- Alimony paid (divorces before 2019)

**Example AGI Calculation:**

Gross Income: $86,700
- Traditional 401(k): -$10,000
- HSA contribution: -$4,000
- Student loan interest: -$1,500
**AGI: $71,200**

### Step 3: Subtract Standard or Itemized Deduction

**Option A: Standard Deduction** (simpler)
- Single: $14,600
- Married joint: $29,200
- Head of household: $21,900

**Option B: Itemized Deductions** (if total exceeds standard deduction)

**Common itemized deductions:**
- Mortgage interest (up to $750K loan)
- State and local taxes (SALT) - capped at $10,000
- Charitable contributions
- Medical expenses (only amount over 7.5% of AGI)
- Casualty losses from federally declared disasters

**Example when to itemize:**
- Mortgage interest: $15,000
- State taxes paid: $8,000
- Charitable giving: $5,000
**Total itemized: $28,000**

If single filer: $28,000 itemized exceeds $14,600 standard → Itemize
If married joint: $28,000 itemized under $29,200 standard → Use standard

### Step 4: Calculate Taxable Income

```
Taxable Income = AGI - Standard or Itemized Deduction
```

**Continuing example (Single filer):**
- AGI: $71,200
- Standard deduction: -$14,600
**Taxable Income: $56,600**

**This is the number you pay tax on.**

## Step-by-Step Tax Calculation

### Example 1: Single Filer, $70,000 Salary

**Step 1: Gross income**
Salary: **$70,000**

**Step 2: Calculate AGI**
- 401(k) contribution: $8,000
AGI: $70,000 - $8,000 = **$62,000**

**Step 3: Subtract standard deduction**
- Standard deduction: $14,600
Taxable income: $62,000 - $14,600 = **$47,400**

**Step 4: Apply tax brackets**

| Bracket | Rate | Taxable Income in Bracket | Tax |
|---------|------|---------------------------|-----|
| $0-$11,600 | 10% | $11,600 | $1,160 |
| $11,601-$47,150 | 12% | $35,550 | $4,266 |
| $47,151-$100,525 | 22% | $250 | $55 |
| **Total** | | **$47,400** | **$5,481** |

**Federal income tax: $5,481**

**Effective rate:** $5,481 ÷ $70,000 gross = **7.8%**

**Marginal rate:** 22% (your top bracket)

### Example 2: Married Filing Jointly, $150,000 Combined

**Step 1: Gross income**
- Spouse 1: $90,000
- Spouse 2: $60,000
**Total: $150,000**

**Step 2: Calculate AGI**
- Spouse 1 401(k): $12,000
- Spouse 2 401(k): $8,000
- HSA (family): $8,550
AGI: $150,000 - $28,550 = **$121,450**

**Step 3: Subtract standard deduction**
- Married standard: $29,200
Taxable income: $121,450 - $29,200 = **$92,250**

**Step 4: Apply tax brackets (Married Joint)**

| Bracket | Rate | Income in Bracket | Tax |
|---------|------|-------------------|-----|
| $0-$23,200 | 10% | $23,200 | $2,320 |
| $23,201-$94,300 | 12% | $69,050 | $8,286 |
| **Total** | | **$92,250** | **$10,606** |

**Federal income tax: $10,606**

**Effective rate:** $10,606 ÷ $150,000 = **7.1%**

**Marginal rate:** 12%

### Example 3: Self-Employed, $120,000 Net Income

**Step 1: Gross income**
Business revenue: $180,000
Business expenses: -$60,000
**Net self-employment income: $120,000**

**Step 2: Calculate self-employment tax**
- SE tax: $120,000 × 0.9235 × 0.153 = **$16,951**
- Half SE tax deduction: $8,476

**Step 3: Calculate AGI**
- Net income: $120,000
- Half SE tax: -$8,476
- Solo 401(k): -$23,500
- Health insurance: -$12,000
AGI: $120,000 - $43,976 = **$76,024**

**Step 4: Subtract standard deduction (Single)**
- Standard deduction: $14,600
Taxable income: $76,024 - $14,600 = **$61,424**

**Step 5: Apply tax brackets**

| Bracket | Rate | Income in Bracket | Tax |
|---------|------|-------------------|-----|
| $0-$11,600 | 10% | $11,600 | $1,160 |
| $11,601-$47,150 | 12% | $35,550 | $4,266 |
| $47,151-$100,525 | 22% | $14,274 | $3,140 |
| **Total** | | **$61,424** | **$8,566** |

**Federal income tax: $8,566**
**Plus self-employment tax: $16,951**
**Total tax burden: $25,517**

**Effective income tax rate:** $8,566 ÷ $120,000 = 7.1%
**Total tax rate (with SE tax):** $25,517 ÷ $120,000 = 21.3%

## Marginal vs. Effective Tax Rate

### Marginal Tax Rate

**Definition:** The tax rate on your last (highest) dollar of income.

**Your tax bracket** = Your marginal rate

**Example:**
Taxable income: $75,000 (Single)
Falls in 22% bracket ($47,151-$100,525)
**Marginal rate: 22%**

**What it means:**
- Each additional dollar earned is taxed at 22%
- $1,000 raise = $220 in additional tax
- Tax deduction saves you 22%

### Effective Tax Rate

**Definition:** Total tax paid divided by total income.

**Formula:**
```
Effective Rate = Federal Tax Owed ÷ Gross Income × 100
```

**Example (same $75,000 income):**

Actual tax paid: $10,294
Effective rate: $10,294 ÷ $75,000 = **13.7%**

**Much lower than 22% marginal rate!**

### Why the Big Difference?

**Because of progressive brackets:**
- First $11,600 taxed at only 10%
- Next $35,550 taxed at only 12%
- Only portion above $47,150 taxed at 22%

**Average across all income is much lower than top bracket.**

### Comparison Table

| Income (Single) | Marginal Rate | Effective Rate | Difference |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| $30,000 | 12% | 6.5% | -5.5% |
| $50,000 | 22% | 9.3% | -12.7% |
| $75,000 | 22% | 12.0% | -10.0% |
| $100,000 | 22% | 14.5% | -7.5% |
| $150,000 | 24% | 17.2% | -6.8% |
| $250,000 | 32% | 21.8% | -10.2% |
| $500,000 | 35% | 28.1% | -6.9% |

**Key insight:** Your effective rate is always significantly lower than your marginal rate.

### When Each Rate Matters

**Use Marginal Rate for:**
- Evaluating raise/bonus impact
- Calculating deduction value
- Deciding on retirement contributions
- Comparing Roth vs. Traditional

**Use Effective Rate for:**
- Understanding actual tax burden
- Comparing to other countries
- Financial planning discussions
- Evaluating overall tax efficiency

## Common Deductions and Credits

### Deductions vs. Credits

**Tax Deduction:**
Reduces taxable income.

Value = Deduction × Marginal Rate

Example: $1,000 deduction in 22% bracket = $220 tax savings

**Tax Credit:**
Reduces tax owed dollar-for-dollar.

Value = Face value of credit

Example: $1,000 credit = $1,000 tax savings

**Credits are more valuable than deductions!**

### Common Tax Credits

**Child Tax Credit:**
- $2,000 per child under 17
- $1,700 refundable (received even if no tax owed)
- Phases out at higher incomes

**Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):**
- For low-to-moderate income workers
- Up to $7,830 (2026, with 3+ kids)
- Fully refundable
- Income limits apply

**Child and Dependent Care Credit:**
- 20-35% of childcare expenses
- Up to $3,000 (one child) or $6,000 (two+ children)
- Max credit: $1,050-2,100

**American Opportunity Tax Credit (Education):**
- $2,500 per student
- First four years of college
- 40% refundable ($1,000)
- Phases out at higher incomes

**Lifetime Learning Credit:**
- Up to $2,000 per tax return
- Any level of postsecondary education
- Not refundable

**Saver's Credit:**
- 10%, 20%, or 50% of retirement contributions
- Up to $1,000 (single) or $2,000 (married)
- Income limits: Under $38,250 (single) or $76,500 (married)

**Residential Energy Credit:**
- 30% of qualified solar, wind, geothermal costs
- No dollar limit
- Includes installation

### Tax Credit Example

**Married couple, $100,000 income, 2 kids:**

Taxable income leads to $10,000 tax liability.

**Credits:**
- Child Tax Credit: $4,000 (2 kids × $2,000)
- Saver's Credit: $400

**Tax after credits:** $10,000 - $4,400 = **$5,600**

**Effective rate:** $5,600 ÷ $100,000 = **5.6%** (very low!)

## State and Local Taxes

### State Income Tax Rates (2026)

**No state income tax (9 states):**
Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming

**Low tax states (under 5%):**

## Tax Reduction Strategies

### Strategy 1: Maximize Retirement Contributions

**Tax Benefit:**
Reduces taxable income dollar-for-dollar.

**2026 Limits:**
- 401(k): $23,500
- IRA: $7,000
- Catch-up (50+): Additional $7,500 (401k), $1,000 (IRA)

**Example:**
$100,000 income, 24% bracket
Contribute $20,000 to 401(k)
**Tax savings: $20,000 × 24% = $4,800**

### Strategy 2: Use Health Savings Account (HSA)

**Triple tax advantage:**
1. Deductible going in
2. Grows tax-free
3. Withdrawals tax-free (for medical)

**2026 Limits:**
- Individual: $4,300
- Family: $8,550
- Catch-up (55+): $1,000

**Example:**
Contribute $8,550 to family HSA
In 24% bracket
**Tax savings: $2,052**

### Strategy 3: Tax-Loss Harvesting

**Strategy:**
Sell investments at a loss to offset gains.

**Example:**
- Stock A: $10,000 gain
- Stock B: $7,000 loss
- Net: $3,000 gain (taxed)
- Sell Stock B: Offset gain
- Result: Only $0 taxable gain

**Benefit:**
Save 15-20% capital gains tax on $7,000 = $1,050-1,400

**Rules:**
- Can deduct $3,000 losses against ordinary income
- Excess losses carry forward
- Watch wash sale rule (can't rebuy same security within 30 days)

### Strategy 4: Charitable Contributions

**Tax Benefit:**
Itemized deduction at marginal rate.

**Example:**
Donate $5,000 to charity
In 24% bracket
**Tax savings: $1,200**

**Advanced: Donate appreciated stock**
- Deduct fair market value
- Avoid capital gains tax
- Double benefit!

**Example:**
Stock cost $2,000, now worth $5,000
Donate stock (not cash):
- Deduct $5,000
- Avoid $3,000 capital gain (save 15% = $450)
- Total benefit: $1,200 + $450 = $1,650

### Strategy 5: Timing Income and Deductions

**If expecting lower income next year:**
Defer income to next year:
- Delay bonus
- Defer consulting payment
- Delay Roth conversion

Accelerate deductions into this year:
- Pay property tax early
- Make January mortgage payment in December
- Increase charitable giving

**If expecting higher income next year:**
Do opposite—accelerate income, defer deductions.

### Strategy 6: Consider Roth Conversions in Low Years

**Strategy:**
Convert Traditional IRA to Roth IRA when income is low.

**Example:**
- Retired at 62
- Before Social Security starts
- Current income: $30,000
- In 12% bracket

Convert $17,150 from Traditional to Roth (fill up 12% bracket)
Pay 12% tax now instead of 22-24% later
**Tax savings: 10-12% on converted amount**

### Strategy 7: Maximize Above-the-Line Deductions

**Why prioritize:**
Benefit even if you take standard deduction.

**Key above-the-line deductions:**
- 401(k), IRA contributions
- HSA contributions
- Student loan interest
- Self-employed health insurance
- Self-employed retirement plan

**These reduce AGI, which:**
- Lowers tax bill
- Helps qualify for credits/deductions with income limits
- Reduces state taxes

### Strategy 8: Bunch Deductions for Itemizing

**Problem:** Itemized deductions just below standard deduction.

**Example (Single):**
- Annual charitable: $5,000
- SALT: $8,000
- Mortgage interest: $6,000
**Total: $19,000 (itemized)**

Standard deduction: $14,600
Benefit from itemizing: $4,400

**Strategy: Bunch every other year**

**Year 1:** Donate $10,000 (two years' worth)
- Charitable: $10,000
- SALT: $8,000
- Mortgage: $6,000
**Total: $24,000 itemized** (saves $9,400 vs. standard)

**Year 2:** Donate $0, take standard ($14,600)

**Two-year total:** $24,000 + $14,600 = $38,600
**vs. annual itemizing:** $19,000 × 2 = $38,000

**Extra savings:** $600

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Progressive brackets:** Higher income taxed at higher rates, but only income in each bracket pays that rate

✓ **Effective rate vs. marginal rate:** Your actual tax burden (effective) is much lower than your top bracket

✓ **Standard deduction:** $14,600 (single) reduces taxable income automatically—most people don't itemize

✓ **Tax credits beat deductions:** $1,000 credit saves $1,000 in taxes; $1,000 deduction saves only $220-370

✓ **Retirement contributions:** Most powerful legal tax reduction—save for future and reduce current taxes

✓ **HSA is triple-tax-advantaged:** Deductible contribution, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals for medical

✓ **State taxes matter:** $100K income can have $0-13,000 difference in state taxes depending on location

✓ **Plan ahead:** Time income and deductions strategically to optimize across tax years

## Conclusion

Calculating your federal income tax involves understanding progressive brackets, determining taxable income through deductions, applying the correct rates, and subtracting any credits. While it may seem complex at first, the basic formula is consistent: Gross income → AGI → Taxable income → Tax liability → Final tax after credits.

The most successful tax planners think proactively, not just at tax time. By maximizing retirement contributions, using tax-advantaged accounts like HSAs, timing income and deductions strategically, and understanding how different financial decisions affect your tax situation, you can legally reduce your tax burden by thousands of dollars each year.

Remember: This guide covers federal income tax only. You'll also owe FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare), state income taxes (in most states), and potentially local taxes. Use our comprehensive income tax calculator to estimate your complete tax liability and explore different scenarios.
