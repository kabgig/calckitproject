### Cost Increase Projections

College costs have historically increased 5-6% annually, outpacing general inflation (2-3%).

**Projected 4-Year Degree Costs** (Public In-State)

| Child's Age | Years Until College | Projected 4-Year Cost |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Newborn | 18 years | $323,000 |
| 5 years old | 13 years | $232,000 |
| 10 years old | 8 years | $170,000 |
| 15 years old | 3 years | $130,000 |

**Projection Formula:**
Future cost = Current cost × (1 + inflation rate)^years

Example for newborn:
$113,400 × (1.06)^18 = $323,000

## How Much Should You Save?

### The 1/3 Rule of College Funding

A realistic approach: Fund college through three sources in equal parts.

**1/3 from College Savings (529, etc.)**
- Start saving early
- Consistent contributions
- Investment growth
- Tax advantages

**1/3 from Current Income**
- Parents' earnings during college years
- Student part-time work
- Summer employment
- Work-study programs

**1/3 from Scholarships, Grants, Financial Aid**
- Merit scholarships
- Need-based aid
- State grants
- Employer tuition assistance

**Example Application:**

Projected 4-year cost: $180,000

**Target savings needed:** $60,000 (1/3)
**Parent income contribution:** $60,000 ($15,000/year × 4)
**Student earnings/aid:** $60,000 ($15,000/year × 4)

### Savings Targets by School Type

**Community College Then Transfer:**
- 2 years community: $23,000
- 2 years university: $57,000
- **Total: $80,000**
- Savings target (1/3): **$27,000**

**Public In-State University:**
- 4-year cost: $113,000 (current)
- With 5% inflation: $160,000 (child age 10)
- Savings target (1/3): **$53,000**

**Public Out-of-State:**
- 4-year cost: $185,000 (current)
- With 5% inflation: $260,000 (child age 10)
- Savings target (1/3): **$87,000**

**Private University:**
- 4-year cost: $243,000 (current)
- With 5% inflation: $342,000 (child age 10)
- Savings target (1/3): **$114,000**

### Age-Based Savings Milestones

**Fidelity's College Savings Milestones:**

| Child's Age | Savings Target* |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 5 years | $7,500 |
| 10 years | $30,000 |
| 15 years | $67,500 |
| 18 years | $120,000 |

*Based on public in-state college costs with 2x future earnings rule

**Explanation:**
These assume saving enough to cover 50% of projected public in-state costs (not full 1/3 rule, more conservative)

## Other College Savings Options

### Option 1: Roth IRA (Backup Strategy)

**How It Works:**
Contribute to Roth IRA, use for college OR retirement.

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Contributions (not earnings) withdrawn anytime, tax/penalty-free
- ✓ Dual purpose: college backup or retirement
- ✓ Doesn't affect financial aid (if in parent's name)
- ✓ More flexibility than 529

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Lower contribution limit ($7,000/year 2026)
- ✗ Income limits apply
- ✗ Can't withdraw earnings for college without penalty
- ✗ Less money available if needed for retirement

**Strategy:**
Max out 529 to reasonable target, then contribute to Roth as college/retirement dual fund.

**Example:**
- 529 balance: $40,000 (sufficient for community college)
- Roth IRA: $50,000 (backup for university or retirement)
- Provides options based on child's choices

### Option 2: Coverdell ESA

**How It Works:**
Education Savings Account similar to 529 but with lower limits.

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Can use for K-12 expenses (broader than 529)
- ✓ More investment options
- ✓ Can use for tutoring, computers, etc.

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Only $2,000/year contribution limit
- ✗ Income limits ($95K-$110K phaseout for single filers)
- ✗ Must use by age 30
- ✗ Too small for meaningful college savings

**Best Use:**
Private K-12 tuition, not primary college savings.

### Option 3: UGMA/UTMA Custodial Accounts

**How It Works:**
Custodial investment account in child's name, parent manages until child reaches adulthood (18-21).

**Advantages:**
- ✓ No contribution limits
- ✓ Flexible investment options
- ✓ Can use for anything benefiting child

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ No special tax treatment
- ✗ "Kiddie tax" on unearned income
- ✗ Counted as student asset (20-25% for financial aid)
- ✗ Becomes child's money at age of majority
- ✗ Can be used for anything (even non-education)

**Tax Treatment:**
- First $1,300: Tax-free
- Next $1,300: Taxed at child's rate
- Above $2,600: Taxed at parent's rate

**Best For:**
When 529 isn't available or child certain not to attend college.

### Option 4: Taxable Brokerage Account

**How It Works:**
Standard investment account in parent's name, earmarked for college.

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Complete flexibility
- ✓ Can use for anything
- ✓ Counts as parent asset (better for financial aid)
- ✓ Control remains with parent
- ✓ No withdrawal restrictions

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ No tax advantages
- ✗ Capital gains taxes
- ✗ Annual income taxes on dividends

**Best For:**
After maximizing 529 and Roth IRA, want additional savings with flexibility.

## Balancing College and Retirement

### The Priority: Retirement First

**Critical Rule:**
You can borrow for college; you cannot borrow for retirement.

**Recommended Priority Order:**

**1. Emergency fund (3-6 months)**
Foundation of financial security

**2. Employer 401(k) match**
Free money—always get full match

**3. HSA contributions (if available)**
Triple tax advantage, covers healthcare

**4. Starter college fund ($5,000-$10,000)**
Get 529 started to benefit from time

**5. Max Roth IRA**
$7,000/year, serves as college backup

**6. 15% to retirement total**
Combination of 401(k), IRA, other accounts

**7. Substantial college savings**
After retirement is on track, boost college contributions

**Example Allocation:**

Combined income: $120,000/year

**Savings breakdown:**
- 401(k) to get match: $9,000 (7.5%)
- Roth IRA (both spouses): $14,000
- 529 Plan: $6,000
**Total: $29,000 (24% savings rate)**

If must choose:
- Reduce 529 to $3,000
- Maintain retirement at $23,000
- Increase college later when income rises

### When College Is 5 Years Away

**Reassess strategy:** 
- Review projected costs
- Calculate funding gap
- Evaluate student contribution
- Research scholarships
- Discuss financial aid

**Options if underfunded:**
1. Student works during school
2. Community college first 2 years
3. In-state public university
4. Student takes federal loans (parent co-signs if necessary)
5. Consider parent PLUS loans (last resort)

**Do NOT:**
- Raid retirement accounts (10% penalty + taxes)
- Stop retirement contributions
- Take on excessive parent debt
- Jeopardize financial security

## Common College Savings Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting Too Late

**The Problem:**
Waiting until high school to start saving, missing years of compound growth.

**The Impact:**

**Starting at birth: $225/month reaches $80,000**
(18 years, 7% return)

**Starting at age 10: $670/month reaches $80,000**
(8 years, 7% return)

**Starting too late:** 3x higher monthly commitment

**The Solution:**
Start with ANY amount, even $25/month. Something is always better than nothing.

### Mistake 2: Oversaving in Child's Name

**The Problem:**
UGMA/UTMA accounts counted as student assets at 20-25% for financial aid. 529 in parent's name only counted at 5.64%.

**Financial Aid Impact Example:**

**Scenario 1: $50,000 in UGMA**
Expected contribution: $10,000-$12,500

**Scenario 2: $50,000 in 529 (parent-owned)**
Expected contribution: $2,820

**Difference:** $7,180-$9,680 less aid per year

**The Solution:**
Use 529 plans instead of custodial accounts when possible.

### Mistake 3: Sacrificing Retirement

**The Problem:**
Prioritizing college over retirement leaves parent financially dependent on children later.

**The Math:**
- Stop retirement saving for 5 years (ages 45-50)
- Lose ~$150,000 in final retirement value
- Cannot make up lost compound growth
- No loans available for retirement

**The Solution:**
Maintain at least 10-15% retirement savings even while funding college.

### Mistake 4: Not Adjusting Risk Over Time

**The Problem:**
Keeping aggressive allocation (90% stocks) when child is 16, then market drops 30%, decimating college fund right before freshman year.

**The Solution:**
Use age-based 529 portfolios that automatically reduce risk as college approaches.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting About Grandparent 529s

**The Problem:**
Grandparent-owned 529s counted as untaxed student income on FAFSA, reducing aid by 50% of distribution.

**The Strategy:**
- Wait until after filing final FAFSA (typically sophomore year)
- Use grandparent 529 for junior/senior years
- Or transfer ownership to parent before junior year

- Monthly: $300

**Child 2 (Age 6):**
- Needs: $60,000 in 12 years
- Current: $10,000
- Monthly: $300

**Child 3 (Age 3):**
- Needs: $68,000 in 15 years

- Income: $300,000/year

**Aggressive Plan:**
- Monthly contribution: $750
- Annual gifts from grandparents: $10,000
- Years: 13
- Expected return: 8%
- **Projected value: $320,000**

**Strategy:**
- Exceeds 1/3 rule
- Provides full tuition coverage
- Room/board from current income
- Cushion for graduate school or siblings

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Start early**: Even $50/month from birth makes a difference

✓ **Use 1/3 rule**: Save 1/3, pay 1/3 from income, get 1/3 from aid/student work

✓ **Maximize 529 benefits**: Tax-free growth, state deductions, high limits

✓ **Age-based portfolios**: Automatically reduce risk as college approaches

✓ **Prioritize retirement first**: Get to 15% retirement before substantial college savings

✓ **Don't sacrifice retirement**: You can borrow for college, not retirement

✓ **Reassess regularly**: Check annually if you're on track

✓ **Have the money conversation early**: Set realistic expectations with children

## Conclusion

Saving for college doesn't mean you need to cover 100% of costs. Using the 1/3 rule—savings, income, and aid—makes college affordable without sacrificing your financial future.

Start early with whatever amount you can afford, use tax-advantaged 529 plans, maintain retirement savings, and adjust your strategy as your child grows. With consistent effort and realistic expectations, you can help your child graduate without crushing debt.
