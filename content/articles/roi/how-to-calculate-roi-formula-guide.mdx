## Basic ROI Formula

### Simple ROI Calculation

The most basic ROI formula measures the gain or loss relative to the initial investment.

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Final Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment × 100%
```

**Alternative format:**
```
ROI = (Gain - Cost) / Cost × 100%
```

**Example 1: Stock Investment**
- Bought stock: $5,000
- Sold stock: $6,500
- Gain: $1,500

ROI = ($6,500 - $5,000) / $5,000 × 100% = **30%**

**Example 2: Rental Property**
- Purchase price: $200,000
- Current value: $280,000
- Gain: $80,000

ROI = ($280,000 - $200,000) / $200,000 × 100% = **40%**

### Including Income in ROI

For investments that generate income (dividends, rent, interest), include that in the calculation.

**Enhanced Formula:**
```
ROI = (Final Value - Initial Investment + Income Received) / Initial Investment × 100%
```

**Example: Dividend-Paying Stock**
- Initial investment: $10,000
- Current value: $11,500
- Dividends received: $800
- Total gain: $11,500 - $10,000 + $800 = $2,300

ROI = $2,300 / $10,000 × 100% = **23%**

### Negative ROI

When an investment loses money, ROI is negative.

**Example: Loss on Investment**
- Initial investment: $5,000
- Current value: $4,000
- Loss: -$1,000

ROI = ($4,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 × 100% = **-20%**

A -20% ROI means you lost 20% of your initial investment.

## Time-Adjusted ROI

Basic ROI doesn't account for how long the investment was held. A 20% ROI in 1 year is much better than 20% in 10 years.

### Annualized ROI

**Formula:**
```
Annualized ROI = [(Final Value / Initial Investment)^(1/Years) - 1] × 100%
```

**Example 1: Short-Term Investment**
- Investment: $10,000
- Value after 2 years: $12,100
- Simple ROI: 21%

Annualized ROI = [($12,100 / $10,000)^(1/2) - 1] × 100%
= [(1.21)^0.5 - 1] × 100%
= [1.10 - 1] × 100%
= **10% per year**

**Example 2: Long-Term Investment**
- Investment: $10,000
- Value after 10 years: $25,000
- Simple ROI: 150%

Annualized ROI = [($25,000 / $10,000)^(1/10) - 1] × 100%
= [(2.5)^0.1 - 1] × 100%
= [1.096 - 1] × 100%
= **9.6% per year**

### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

CAGR is another term for annualized ROI, commonly used in finance.

**Same Formula:**
```
CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Years) - 1] × 100%
```

**Example: Stock Portfolio**
- Starting value 2020: $50,000
- Ending value 2026: $85,000
- Years: 6

CAGR = [($85,000 / $50,000)^(1/6) - 1] × 100%
= [(1.7)^0.167 - 1] × 100%
= **9.2% per year**

This means the portfolio grew an average of 9.2% per year over 6 years.

## ROI by Investment Type

### Stock Market Investments

**Simple Stock Purchase:**
- Buy: $3,000
- Sell: $4,200
- Time: 2 years

ROI = ($4,200 - $3,000) / $3,000 × 100% = **40%**
Annualized: **18.3% per year**

**With Dividends:**
- Initial investment: $20,000
- Value after 5 years: $28,000
- Dividends received: $3,500
- Total gain: $28,000 - $20,000 + $3,500 = $11,500

ROI = $11,500 / $20,000 × 100% = **57.5%**
Annualized: **9.5% per year**

### Real Estate Investments

**Rental Property ROI:**

Purchase details:
- Purchase price: $300,000
- Down payment: $60,000 (20%)
- Closing costs: $8,000
- **Total investment: $68,000**

Annual income:
- Rent: $2,500/month = $30,000/year
- Expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA): $10,000/year
- Mortgage payment: $16,000/year
- **Net cash flow: $4,000/year**

After 5 years:
- Total cash flow: $4,000 × 5 = $20,000
- Property value: $350,000
- Loan balance: $220,000
- Equity: $350,000 - $220,000 = $130,000
- Gain: $130,000 - $68,000 = $62,000
- Plus cash flow: $62,000 + $20,000 = $82,000

ROI = $82,000 / $68,000 × 100% = **120.6%**
Annualized: **17.2% per year**

**House Flip ROI:**

Purchase and renovation:
- Purchase price: $200,000
- Renovation: $50,000
- Holding costs (6 months): $5,000
- Selling costs (agent fees, closing): $18,000
- **Total investment: $273,000**

Sale:
- Sale price: $320,000
- Profit: $320,000 - $273,000 = $47,000

ROI = $47,000 / $273,000 × 100% = **17.2%**
Time: 6 months
Annualized: **34.4% per year**

### Business Investments

**Marketing Campaign ROI:**

Campaign costs:
- Ad spend: $10,000
- Creative/design: $2,000
- **Total cost: $12,000**

Results:
- New customers: 50
- Average purchase: $400
- Revenue: 50 × $400 = $20,000
- Profit margin: 40%
- Profit: $20,000 × 0.40 = $8,000
- Net profit: $8,000 - $12,000 = -$4,000

ROI = -$4,000 / $12,000 × 100% = **-33.3%**
(Campaign lost money)

**Equipment Purchase ROI:**

Equipment cost:
- Purchase price: $50,000
- Installation: $5,000
- Training: $3,000
- **Total investment: $58,000**

Benefits over 5 years:
- Increased production capacity: $20,000/year
- Reduced labor costs: $8,000/year
- Total annual benefit: $28,000/year
- 5-year total: $140,000

ROI = ($140,000 - $58,000) / $58,000 × 100% = **141.4%**
Annualized: **19.3% per year**

### Education ROI

**Bachelor's Degree:**

Costs (4 years):
- Tuition: $80,000
- Books: $5,000
- Room & board: $50,000
- **Total: $135,000**

Lost income (4 years at $30K/year): $120,000
**Total investment: $255,000**

Career earnings increase:
- High school grad average: $35,000/year
- College grad average: $55,000/year
- Difference: $20,000/year

Over 40-year career:
- Additional earnings: $20,000 × 40 = $800,000
- Minus investment: $800,000 - $255,000 = $545,000

ROI = $545,000 / $255,000 × 100% = **214%**
But annualized over 40 years: **2.8% per year**

**Professional Certification:**

Costs:
- Course: $3,000
- Exam: $500
- Study time (100 hours at $30/hour): $3,000
- **Total: $6,500**

Salary increase:
- Before: $60,000/year
- After: $72,000/year
- Increase: $12,000/year

Payback period: $6,500 / $12,000 = 0.54 years (6.5 months)

5-year ROI:
- Benefit: $12,000 × 5 = $60,000
- ROI = ($60,000 - $6,500) / $6,500 × 100% = **823%**

## Comparing Investment Returns

### Apples to Apples Comparison

When comparing different investments, always use annualized ROI and account for all costs.

**Example Comparison:**

**Investment A: Index Fund**
- Initial: $10,000
- Value after 10 years: $25,000
- Simple ROI: 150%
- Annualized: 9.6%

**Investment B: Rental Property**
- Initial: $60,000 (down payment + costs)
- Annual cash flow: $4,000
- Total cash flow (10 years): $40,000
- Property appreciation: $300K to $400K
- Equity after 10 years: $160,000
- Total gain: $160,000 - $60,000 + $40,000 = $140,000
- Simple ROI: 233%
- Annualized: 12.7%

**Investment C: Small Business**
- Initial: $50,000
- Annual profit: $15,000
- Total profit (5 years): $75,000
- Sale value: $80,000
- Total gain: $75,000 + $80,000 - $50,000 = $105,000
- Simple ROI: 210%
- Annualized: 25.4%

**Comparison:**
- Small Business: 25.4% annual (highest return, highest risk/effort)
- Rental Property: 12.7% annual (moderate return, moderate effort)
- Index Fund: 9.6% annual (good return, zero effort)

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

Higher ROI isn't always better if risk is significantly higher.

**Sharpe Ratio** (advanced metric):
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation
```

Measures return per unit of risk. Higher is better.

**Example:**
- Investment A: 12% return, 8% volatility
  Sharpe: (12% - 2%) / 8% = 1.25
- Investment B: 18% return, 18% volatility
  Sharpe: (18% - 2%) / 18% = 0.89

Investment A has better risk-adjusted returns despite lower absolute return.

## Advanced ROI Metrics

### Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV accounts for the time value of money—a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.

**Formula:**
```
NPV = Sum of [Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year] - Initial Investment
```

**Example:**

Investment: $10,000 initial
Cash flows: $3,000/year for 5 years
Discount rate: 8%

```
Year 1: $3,000 / (1.08)^1 = $2,778
Year 2: $3,000 / (1.08)^2 = $2,572
Year 3: $3,000 / (1.08)^3 = $2,381
Year 4: $3,000 / (1.08)^4 = $2,205
Year 5: $3,000 / (1.08)^5 = $2,041
Total PV: $11,977
NPV: $11,977 - $10,000 = $1,977
```

Positive NPV = good investment

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV equal to zero—essentially the actual annual return.

**When to use:**
- Multiple cash flows over time
- Uneven cash flows
- Comparing projects with different timelines

**Example:**

Year 0: -$10,000 (investment)
Year 1: $2,000
Year 2: $3,000
Year 3: $4,000
Year 4: $5,000

IRR = 19.4% (requires calculator or Excel)

This means the investment yields 19.4% per year.

### Cash-on-Cash Return

Used primarily in real estate, measures annual cash flow vs. cash invested.

**Formula:**
```
Cash-on-Cash Return = Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested × 100%
```

**Example:**

Property investment:
- Down payment: $50,000
- Closing costs: $8,000
- Total invested: $58,000

Annual cash flow:
- Rent: $24,000
- Expenses: $8,000
- Mortgage: $11,000
- **Net cash flow: $5,000**

Cash-on-Cash = $5,000 / $58,000 × 100% = **8.6%**

## Common ROI Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Time

**The Problem:**
Comparing 20% ROI over 1 year to 20% ROI over 5 years as if they're equal.

**Example:**
- Investment A: 20% ROI in 1 year = 20% annualized
- Investment B: 20% ROI in 5 years = 3.7% annualized

Investment A is 5.4x better!

**The Solution:**
Always annualize returns for fair comparison.

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Costs

**The Problem:**
Only calculating ROI on purchase price, not total investment.

**Example:**

House flip:
- Purchase: $200,000
- Renovation: $50,000
- Holding costs: $10,000
- Selling costs: $18,000

❌ **Wrong calculation:**
- Sale: $320,000
- ROI: ($320,000 - $200,000) / $200,000 = 60%

✓ **Correct calculation:**
- Total investment: $278,000
- ROI: ($320,000 - $278,000) / $278,000 = 15.1%

**The Solution:**
Include ALL costs: closing costs, taxes, fees, holding costs, opportunity costs.

### Mistake 3: Not Including Income

**The Problem:**
Only calculating appreciation, ignoring dividends/rent/interest.

**Example:**

Rental property:
- Purchase: $300,000
- Value after 10 years: $400,000

❌ **Incomplete:**
ROI = ($400,000 - $300,000) / $300,000 = 33%

✓ **Complete:**
- Property appreciation: $100,000
- Rental income (10 years): $120,000
- Total gain: $220,000
- ROI: $220,000 / $300,000 = 73%

### Mistake 4: Leveraged vs. Unleveraged Confusion

**The Problem:**
Comparing leveraged investment (uses loan) to unleveraged without adjusting.

**Example:**

**Property A (Leveraged):**
- Price: $300,000
- Down payment: $60,000
- Property appreciates 20%: $360,000
- Gain on $60,000 investment: $60,000
- ROI: 100%

**Property B (Cash):**
- Price: $300,000
- Cash paid: $300,000
- Property appreciates 20%: $360,000
- Gain: $60,000
- ROI: 20%

Property A shows higher ROI because of leverage, but has more risk and mortgage costs.

**The Solution:**
Acknowledge leverage in your comparison. Account for mortgage interest costs.

### Mistake 5: Survivorship Bias

**The Problem:**
Only calculating ROI on successful investments, ignoring failures.

**Example:**

Started 10 businesses:
- 7 failed completely: Lost $50,000 each
- 3 succeeded: Made $200,000 each

❌ **Misleading calculation:**
"My successful businesses had 300% ROI!"

✓ **Reality:**
- Total invested: $500,000 (10 × $50,000)
- Total returned: $600,000 (3 × $200,000)
- Actual ROI: 20%

**The Solution:**
Calculate portfolio ROI, not just winners.

## Real ROI Examples

### Example 1: Home Solar Panel Installation

**Investment:**
- Solar panel system: $25,000
- Tax credit (30%): -$7,500
- **Net investment: $17,500**

**Savings:**
- Annual electricity savings: $2,100
- System lifespan: 25 years
- Total savings: $52,500

Simple ROI = ($52,500 - $17,500) / $17,500 × 100% = **200%**
Payback period: $17,500 / $2,100 per year = 8.3 years
Annualized ROI: **4.5% per year**

### Example 2: Certificate of Deposit (CD)

**Investment:**
- Principal: $20,000
- Interest rate: 5% APY
- Term: 5 years

**Calculation:**
Final value = $20,000 × (1.05)^5 = $25,526
Gain = $5,526

ROI = $5,526 / $20,000 × 100% = **27.6%**
Annualized: **5% per year** (matches APY)

### Example 3: Stock Market Index Fund (Historical)

**20-Year S&P 500 Investment (2006-2026):**
- Initial: $10,000
- Final value (with dividends reinvested): $45,000
- Gain: $35,000

ROI = $35,000 / $10,000 × 100% = **350%**
Annualized: **7.7% per year**

Includes 2008 crash, COVID crash, and recovery. Shows long-term market returns.

### Example 4: Small Business Startup

**Investment:**
- Startup costs: $75,000
- Working capital: $25,000
- **Total: $100,000**

**Year 1-5 Profits:**
- Year 1: -$20,000 (loss)
- Year 2: $30,000
- Year 3: $50,000
- Year 4: $60,000
- Year 5: $75,000
- **Total profit: $195,000**

Business value after 5 years: $300,000
Owner's salary (above normal job): $50,000/year × 5 = $250,000

**Total benefit:**
$195,000 (profit) + $300,000 (value) + $250,000 (extra salary) = $745,000

ROI = ($745,000 - $100,000) / $100,000 × 100% = **645%**
Annualized: **49.2% per year**

(Exceptional return, but with extreme risk and effort)

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Basic formula**: (Final Value - Initial Cost) / Initial Cost × 100%

✓ **Include all costs**: Purchase, fees, taxes, opportunity costs

✓ **Include all income**: Dividends, rent, interest, cash flow

✓ **Annualize returns**: Makes different timeframes comparable

✓ **Consider risk**: Higher ROI isn't always better if much riskier

✓ **Account for time value**: Use NPV for multi-year projects

✓ **Be honest**: Include failures, not just successes

✓ **Context matters**: Leverage amplifies returns (and risk)

## Conclusion

ROI is a powerful tool for evaluating investments, but only when calculated correctly and compared fairly. Always account for all costs, include income generated, annualize returns for fair comparison, and consider risk alongside returns.

Whether you're evaluating stocks, real estate, business ventures, or personal decisions like education, proper ROI calculation helps you make informed choices about where to allocate your money and time.
