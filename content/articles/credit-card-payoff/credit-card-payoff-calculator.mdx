# Credit Card Payoff Calculator: How Long to Pay Off & Interest Costs 2026

Credit card debt costs Americans $120 billion annually in interest—averaging 21% APR in 2026—yet most cardholders paying only minimums will take 20-30 years to pay off a $5,000 balance and spend $10,000+ in interest. Someone with $5,000 at 21% APR making $125 minimum payments ($125 → eventually dropping to $10 as balance shrinks) will pay for 38 years and spend $13,467 in interest—nearly 3x the original debt.

This comprehensive guide covers credit card interest calculations, the minimum payment trap, how long payoff actually takes, avalanche vs snowball repayment strategies, balance transfer math, debt consolidation comparisons, and proven methods to become debt-free faster.

## How Credit Card Interest Works

### Daily Compound Interest

**Credit cards charge interest daily, not monthly**

**Formula:**
```
Daily Rate = APR / 365
Daily Interest = Balance × Daily Rate
```

**Example: $5,000 balance, 21% APR**
- Daily rate: 21% / 365 = 0.0575% per day
- Day 1 interest: $5,000 × 0.000575 = $2.88
- New balance: $5,002.88
- Day 2 interest: $5,002.88 × 0.000575 = $2.88
- Continues daily...

**After 30 days with no payment:**
- Interest charged: ~$86
- New balance: $5,086

### Average Daily Balance Method

**Most cards use average daily balance:**

**Example: $5,000 starting balance**
- Days 1-10: $5,000
- Day 11: Purchase $500 → Balance $5,500
- Days 11-20: $5,500
- Day 21: Payment $1,000 → Balance $4,500
- Days 21-30: $4,500

**Average daily balance:**
(10 days × $5,000) + (10 days × $5,500) + (10 days × $4,500) / 30
= ($50,000 + $55,000 + $45,000) / 30
= **$5,000**

**Interest charged:** $5,000 × (21% / 12) = $87.50

### APR vs Interest Rate

**APR = Annual Percentage Rate**
**But charged daily and compounded**

**Effective Annual Rate (EAR) is higher due to compounding:**
```
EAR = (1 + APR/365)^365 - 1
```

**21% APR:**
- Stated rate: 21%
- Effective rate: 23.4%

**The compounding effect adds 2.4%!**

### Grace Period

**Purchase grace period: 21-25 days**
- **If you pay statement balance in full:** No interest!
- **If you carry balance:** Grace period lost, interest accrues from purchase date

**Example: Lost grace period**
- March statement: $2,000 balance
- Pay $1,800 (not full amount)
- April purchases: $500
- **All $500 charged interest from purchase date** (no grace period)

**To restore grace period:** Pay full statement balance for 2 consecutive months

### Cash Advance Fees

**Cash advances: Immediately accrue interest (no grace period)**

**Typical terms:**
- Fee: 3-5% of advance (minimum $10)
- APR: 25-30% (higher than purchase APR)
- Interest starts immediately

**Example: $1,000 cash advance**
- Fee: $50 (5%)
- Total borrowed: $1,000
- Effective amount: $1,050
- Interest day 1: $1,050 × (28% / 365) = $0.80/day
- After 30 days: $1,050 + $24 = $1,074

**Avoid cash advances!** Payday loans cheaper in comparison.

### Purchase vs Balance Transfer APR

**Cards often have different rates:**

**Example card:**
- Purchase APR: 19.99%
- Balance transfer APR: 0% for 15 months, then 24.99%
- Cash advance APR: 29.99%

**Payments apply to lowest APR first** (by law, must apply to highest after minimum)

Wait, that's wrong. Actually:
**Payments over minimum must apply to highest APR first** (CARD Act 2009)

**Example: $2,000 purchase (20% APR) + $3,000 balance transfer (0% APR)**
- Minimum payment: $125
- You pay: $500
- $125 goes to 0% balance (minimum allocation)
- $375 goes to 20% purchase balance (above minimum, targets high APR)

## The Minimum Payment Trap

### How Minimum Payments Are Calculated

**Typical minimum payment formulas:**

**Method 1: Percentage (most common)**
```
Minimum = Greater of:
- 1-3% of balance, OR
- $25-35 (fixed floor)
```

**Example: $5,000 balance, 2% minimum**
- Month 1: $100 ($5,000 × 2%)
- Month 10: $82 (balance down to $4,100)
- Month 50: $35 (balance down to $1,200, but hits floor)

**Method 2: Interest + Percentage of Principal**
```
Minimum = Interest + (1% of principal)
```

**Example: $5,000 at 21% APR**
- Monthly interest: $87.50
- Principal: $50 (1%)
- **Minimum: $138**

**Method 3: Fixed Percentage**
```
Minimum = 2-4% of balance (no floor)
```

### The 30-Year Minimum Payment Reality

**$5,000 balance, 21% APR, 2% minimum payments:**

**Payment schedule:**
- Month 1: Pay $100 ($87.50 interest + $12.50 principal)
- Month 12: Pay $91 (balance $4,564)
- Month 60: Pay $56 (balance $2,796)
- Month 120: Pay $35 (balance $1,467)
- Month 240: Pay $25 (balance $427)
- **Month 387: Final payment** (32.25 years!)

**Total interest paid: $8,202** (164% of original balance!)

**Most people don't realize minimum payments designed to maximize bank profit**

### Minimum Payment Example by Balance

**Various balances, 21% APR, 2% minimum:**

| Balance | Monthly Minimum | Years to Payoff | Total Interest | Total Paid |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| $2,000 | $40 → $35 floor | 13.5 years | $2,240 | $4,240 |
| $5,000 | $100 → $35 floor | 32.25 years | $8,202 | $13,202 |
| $10,000 | $200 → $35 floor | 40+ years | $18,000+ | $28,000+ |
| $15,000 | $300 → $35 floor | Never! | Infinite | Infinite |

**Above $12-15K with minimum payments: Balance never reaches $0** (interest > minimum payment)

### Why Minimums Keep You Trapped

**The math is brutal:**

**$5,000 at 21% APR:**
- Monthly interest: $87.50
- Minimum payment (2%): $100
- **Principal reduction: $12.50/month**

**At this rate, paying off $5,000 takes 400 months** (33 years)

**After 5 years:**
- Paid: $5,580
- Still owe: $4,122
- Only reduced debt by $878!

**Credit card companies design minimums to maximize profit**

### The Shrinking Payment Problem

**As balance decreases, so does minimum payment:**

**Start: $5,000, 2% minimum = $100/month**
**After 3 years: $3,800, 2% minimum = $76/month**

**You're paying less as time goes on** (feels easier, but extends payoff massively)

**Solution: Pay fixed amount** (don't decrease payment as balance falls)

**$5,000 debt:**
- Minimum payments: 32 years, $13,202 total
- Fixed $150/month: 4 years, $7,147 total
- **Saved: 28 years and $6,055!**

## Calculating Payoff Timeline

### Fixed Payment Formula

**Months to payoff:**
```
N = -(log(1 - (B × r / P))) / log(1 + r)
```

Where:
- B = Balance
- r = Monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
- P = Fixed monthly payment
- N = Number of months

**Example: $5,000 balance, 21% APR, $200/month**
- r = 21% / 12 = 0.0175
- N = -(log(1 - (5000 × 0.0175 / 200))) / log(1.0175)
- N = -(log(1 - 0.4375)) / log(1.0175)
- N = -(log(0.5625)) / 0.0173
- N = 0.2499 / 0.0173
- **N = 32.5 months** (2.7 years)

### Payment Amount to Reach Goal

**Want to pay off in specific time? Calculate required payment:**

```
Payment = (B × r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-N)
```

**Example: Pay off $5,000 in 2 years (24 months), 21% APR**
- r = 0.0175
- N = 24
- Payment = (5000 × 0.0175) / (1 - (1.0175)^-24)
- Payment = 87.50 / (1 - 0.6509)
- Payment = 87.50 / 0.3491
- **Payment = $251/month**

### Total Interest Calculation

**Total interest paid:**
```
Total Interest = (Payment × Months) - Original Balance
```

**$5,000 at 21% APR, $200/month:**
- Payoff: 32.5 months
- Total paid: $200 × 32.5 = $6,500
- **Interest: $6,500 - $5,000 = $1,500**

**Compare to minimum payments:**
- Interest: $8,202
- **Paying $200 fixed saves $6,702!**

### Impact of Extra Payments

**$5,000 debt, 21% APR, compare payments:**

| Monthly Payment | Months | Total Interest | Total Paid |
|----------------|--------|----------------|------------|
| $100 (minimum) | 387 | $8,202 | $13,202 |
| $150 | 46 | $1,744 | $6,744 |
| $200 | 32.5 | $1,008 | $6,008 |
| $250 | 24 | $612 | $5,612 |
| $300 | 19 | $388 | $5,388 |
| $400 | 14 | $195 | $5,195 |

**Doubling payment from $150 to $300:**
- Payoff: 46 months → 19 months (27 months faster!)
- Interest: $1,744 → $388 ($1,356 saved!)

**Every extra dollar makes huge difference**

### Multiple Cards Priority

**Three cards:**
- Card A: $3,000 at 18% APR (minimum $60)
- Card B: $2,000 at 24% APR (minimum $40)
- Card C: $5,000 at 15% APR (minimum $100)

**Total: $10,000 debt, $200 minimum payments**

**You can pay $400/month total:**
- Pay minimums on all: $200
- Extra $200 to apply strategically

**Strategy matters! See avalanche vs snowball below**

## Avalanche vs Snowball Method

### Debt Avalanche Method

**Pay highest interest rate first**

**Why:** Mathematically optimal, saves most interest

**Strategy:**
1. List all debts by interest rate (highest first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put all extra money to highest rate
4. When highest paid off, attack next highest

**Example:**
- Card A: $3,000 at 18% (minimum $60)
- Card B: $2,000 at 24% (minimum $40)
- Card C: $5,000 at 15% (minimum $100)
- Available: $400/month

**Avalanche order:**
1. Card B (24% highest)
2. Card A (18%)
3. Card C (15%)

**Month-by-month:**
- Pay minimums: A=$60, C=$100 (total $160)
- Remaining $240 → Card B
- **Card B paid off:** Month 9
- Then: $240 + $40 (B's old minimum) = $280 → Card A
- **Card A paid off:** Month 18
- Then: $280 + $60 = $340 → Card C
- **Card C paid off:** Month 31

**Total time: 31 months**
**Total interest: $2,234**

### Debt Snowball Method

**Pay smallest balance first**

**Why:** Psychological wins motivate you

**Strategy:**
1. List debts by balance (smallest first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put all extra money to smallest balance
4. When smallest paid off, roll payment to next smallest

**Same example, snowball order:**
1. Card B ($2,000 smallest)
2. Card A ($3,000)
3. Card C ($5,000 largest)

**Month-by-month:**
- Pay minimums: A=$60, C=$100 (total $160)
- Remaining $240 → Card B
- **Card B paid off:** Month 9 (same as avalanche!)
- Then: $280 → Card A (also same!)
- **Card A paid off:** Month 18
- Then: $340 → Card C
- **Card C paid off:** Month 31

**In this case: Identical result!** (Smallest balance happened to be highest rate)

**Different example:**
- Card A: $1,000 at 15%
- Card B: $4,000 at 20%
- Card C: $3,000 at 18%

**Snowball order:** A ($1,000), C ($3,000), B ($4,000)
**Avalanche order:** B (20%), C (18%), A (15%)

**Snowball result:**
- Time: 28 months
- Interest: $1,850

**Avalanche result:**
- Time: 27 months
- Interest: $1,720

**Avalanche saves: $130 and 1 month**

**But snowball gives you win after 5 months** (Card A paid off), might keep you motivated!

### Which Method to Choose?

**Choose Avalanche if:**
- Disciplined and motivated by math
- Interest rates vary significantly
- Want to minimize total interest

**Choose Snowball if:**
- Struggle with motivation
- Need psychological wins
- Rates similar, balances very different

**Example: Snowball makes sense**
- Card A: $500 at 19%
- Card B: $6,000 at 20%
- Card C: $4,000 at 21%

**Rates similar (19-21%)** but balances very different

**Snowball:** Pay off $500 in 2-3 months (quick win!)
**Avalanche:** Attack $4K first, no wins for 18 months

**Motivation matters more than $50 interest savings**

### Hybrid Approach

**Practical compromise:**

1. Pay off any balance under $500 first (quick wins)
2. Then switch to avalanche (highest rate)

**Example:**
- Card A: $400 at 18%
- Card B: $5,000 at 21%
- Card C: $3,000 at 19%
- Card D: $600 at 17%

**Hybrid:**
1. Kill A ($400) - Month 2
2. Kill D ($600) - Month 4
3. Attack B (21% highest) - Months 5-20
4. Attack C (19%) - Months 21-32

**Benefits:**
- Two quick wins (motivation!)
- Then mathematically optimal
- Saves nearly as much as pure avalanche

## Balance Transfer Strategy

### How Balance Transfers Work

**Transfer high-interest debt to 0% APR card:**

**Typical offer:**
- 0% APR for 12-21 months
- Balance transfer fee: 3-5%
- After promo: 18-25% APR

**Example: Transfer $5,000**
- Fee: 3% = $150
- New balance: $5,150
- APR: 0% for 18 months

**Goal: Pay off during 0% period**

### Balance Transfer Math

**$5,000 at 21% APR vs balance transfer:**

**Keep at 21%:**
- Pay $300/month for 18 months
- Balance remaining: $548
- Interest paid: $1,268

**Transfer to 0% (with 3% fee):**
- Pay $300/month for 18 months
- Balance remaining: $0!
- Interest paid: $0 (just $150 fee)

**Savings: $1,118** ($1,268 interest - $150 fee)

### When Balance Transfer Makes Sense

**Good candidates:**
- Can pay off during 0% period
- Fair to excellent credit (660+)
- Disciplined (won't rack up new debt)
- High current APR (18%+)

**Required payment to pay off in promo period:**

**$5,000 transfer (0% for 18 months, 3% fee):**
- New balance: $5,150
- Months: 18
- **Required payment: $286/month**

**Can you afford $286/month?** If not, balance transfer won't help much.

### Balance Transfer Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Not paying off in time**
- Transfer $5,000 to 0% for 18 months
- Pay $200/month
- After 18 months: $1,400 remaining
- APR jumps to 24%!
- Back to square one (just delayed)

**Mistake 2: Continuing to use old card**
- Transfer balance, feel relief
- Start using old card again
- Now have NEW debt at 21% PLUS transferred balance
- Doubled your problem!

**Mistake 3: Multiple transfers**
- Transfer again and again (card hopping)
- Each transfer: 3-5% fee
- Credit score impact (hard inquiries, utilization spikes)
- Eventually no more 0% offers

**Mistake 4: Not reading fine print**
- Deferred interest (not true 0%): If not paid off, ALL interest charged retroactively!
- Different from 0% promotional (interest only on remaining balance)

### Best Balance Transfer Cards 2026

**Hypothetical offers:**

**Card 1:**
- 0% APR: 21 months
- Transfer fee: 3%
- After promo: 19.99%

**Card 2:**
- 0% APR: 18 months
- Transfer fee: 0% (rare!)
- After promo: 24.99%

**Card 3:**
- 0% APR: 15 months
- Transfer fee: 5%
- After promo: 18.99%

**Best: Card 2** (no fee beats 3-6 extra months if you'll pay off anyway)

**Second best: Card 1** (longest period, low fee)

### Balance Transfer Strategy

**Maximum benefit:**

1. **Calculate required payment:** Balance ÷ Promo months
2. **Confirm you can afford it:** If not, transfer won't solve problem
3. **Apply for card:** Need good credit (680+)
4. **Transfer immediately:** Don't wait
5. **Set up automatic payment:** Required payment + buffer
6. **Freeze old cards:** Don't use them!
7. **Track promo end date:** Mark calendar
8. **Pay off before end:** Avoid post-promo rate

## Debt Consolidation Options

### Personal Loan Consolidation

**Take fixed-rate personal loan, pay off all cards:**

**Example: $10,000 credit card debt at 21% average**
- Minimum payments: $250/month
- Years to payoff: 30+
- Interest: $18,000+

**Personal loan: $10,000 at 10% for 3 years**
- Fixed payment: $323/month
- Total interest: $1,614
- Payoff: Exactly 3 years

**Savings: $16,386 in interest!**

**Plus:**
- Fixed payment (no surprises)
- Fixed end date (psychological relief)
- Single payment (simpler)

### Personal Loan Rates 2026

**Rates vary by credit score:**

| Credit Score | APR Range | $10K 3-Year Payment |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 720+ (Excellent) | 7-12% | $309-$332 |
| 680-719 (Good) | 10-18% | $323-$361 |
| 640-679 (Fair) | 15-24% | $348-$391 |
| Under 640 (Poor) | 20-36% | $386-$468 |

**Must have decent credit** (640+) to beat credit card rates.

### When Loan Consolidation Makes Sense

**Good fit :**
- Credit cards at 18%+
- Can qualify for loan under 15%
- Disciplined (won't run up cards again!)
- Stable income (afford fixed payment)

**Not worth it:**
- Loan rate same/higher than cards
- Can't afford payment
- Likely to use cards again
- Consolidating small balances ($2K or less—closing costs eat savings)

### Home Equity Loan/HELOC

**Borrow against home equity:**

**Pros:**
- Lowest rates (6-9% typical)
- Large amounts ($20K-100K+)
- Tax deductible (if used for home improvement)

**Cons:**
- Home is collateral (can lose house!)
- Closing costs ($500-2,000)
- Converts unsecured debt to secured

**Example: $30,000 credit card debt at 22%**
- Minimum payments: $750/month (40-year payoff!)
- Interest: $100,000+

**HELOC at 8%, 10-year term:**
- Payment: $364/month
- Interest: $13,680
- **Saves: $86,320**

**BUT: Miss payments → Foreclosure risk**

**Only if:** Disciplined, stable income, emergency fund

### Debt Management Plan (DMP)

**Credit counseling agency negotiates with creditors:**

**How it works:**
1. Credit counselor reviews debts
2. Negotiates lower rates (8-12% typical)
3. Sets up payment plan (3-5 years)
4. You make single payment to agency
5. Agency distributes to creditors

**Example: $15,000 credit card debt, 23% average**
- Current payments: $400/month (never pays off)

**DMP:**
- Negotiated rate: 9%
- Payment: $350/month
- Payoff: 4 years
- Saves: $8,000+ in interest

**Costs:**
- Setup fee: $50-75
- Monthly fee: $25-50

**Impact:**
- Must close credit card accounts
- Noted on credit report (but not as bad as bankruptcy)
- Can't open new credit during plan

### Bankruptcy (Last Resort)

**Chapter 7: Discharge debts**
- Wipes out unsecured debt (credit cards, medical)
- Keep limited assets (varies by state)
- Doesn't discharge student loans, child support, recent taxes
- Stays on credit 10 years
- Nuclear option

**Chapter 13: Repayment plan**
- 3-5 year court-ordered payment plan
- Keep assets
- Pay portion of debts (20-50% typical)
- Rest discharged
- Stays on credit 7 years

**Only if:** Truly overwhelmed, $25K+ unsecured debt, income can't cover

## Negotiating Lower Rates

### Call Your Credit Card Company

**You can negotiate lower APR:**

**Success rate: 50-70%** if you:
- Have good payment history
- Been customer 1+ years
- Credit score improved since opening

**Script:**

"Hi, I've been a customer for 3 years and always paid on time. My current APR is 24.99%. I've received offers for cards at 18%. I'd prefer to stay with you—can you lower my rate to match?"

**Possible outcomes:**
- Yes, we'll lower to 20% (partial win)
- No, but we'll waive annual fee (something)
- No (end call, try again in 6 months)

**Worth 15-minute call!**

**Example savings:**
- Balance: $5,000
- Rate drop: 24% → 19%
- Payment: $200/month fixed
- **Saves: $328 in interest, 3 months faster payoff**

### When to Negotiate

**Best times:**
- Credit score increased 50+ points
- Paid on time for 12+ months
- Received competing offer (mention it!)
- Annual fee renewal coming up
- Rate just increased

**What card companies care about:**
- Keeping you as customer
- Your payment history
- Your credit score
- Competitors' offers

- Fee: 3% ($210)
- New balance: $7,210

**Required payment:**
- $7,210 / 18 = $401/month

**Can afford:** $425/month (includes $24 buffer)

**Result:**
- **Paid off in 17 months** (1 month early!)
- Interest: $0 (just $210 fee)
- Total paid: $7,210

**vs staying at 23%:**
- 18 months paying $425/month
- Remaining balance: $480
- Interest paid: $1,894
- Then balance at 23% again

**Savings: $1,684** ($1,894 - $210 fee)

### Scenario 4: Debt Consolidation Loan

**Profile:**
- Card A: $4,000 at 21%
- Card B: $3,000 at 19%
- Card C: $5,000 at 24%
- Total: $12,000, paying $350/month minimums
- Credit score: 680

**Personal loan offer:**
- $12,000 at 12% APR
- 4-year term
- Payment: $316/month

**Analysis:**

**Credit cards (paying $350/month):**
- Payoff: 6-7 years
- Interest: $7,200
- Total: $19,200

**Personal loan:**
- Payoff: Exactly 4 years
- Interest: $3,168
- Total: $15,168

**Savings: $4,032** (plus 2-3 years faster)

**Decision: Take loan, close cards**

### Scenario 5: Snowball Method Motivation

**Profile:**
- Card A: $800 at 18%
- Card B: $6,000 at 22%
- Card C: $4,500 at 20%
- Card D: $1,200 at 19%
- Total: $12,500
- Budget: $450/month
- Struggled with debt for 3 years, needs motivation

**Snowball order:** A ($800), D ($1,200), C ($4,500), B ($6,000)

**Timeline:**
- Month 3: **A paid off!** (first victory)
- Month 6: **D paid off!** (two down!)
- Month 17: **C paid off!** (three down!)
- Month 31: **D paid off!** (debt-free!)

**Total: 31 months**
**Interest: $3,240**

**Avalanche would save:** ~$180 interest (not much)

**But:** Snowball gave 2 wins in 6 months (kept going!)

**Avalanche timeline:** First payoff at month 15 (might have given up by then)

**Sometimes motivation > math**

### Scenario 6: Failed Consolidation

**Profile:**
- Consolidated $10,000 credit cards with personal loan
- Paid off cards
- **Mistake: Kept cards open and used them!**

**6 months later:**
- Personal loan: $9,000 remaining (paying)
- Cards: $4,000 NEW debt!
- Total: $13,000 (worse than before!)

**Problem: Didn't change spending habits**

**Solution required:**
- Cut up cards (not just close—cut!)
- Address root cause (overspending)
- Budget strictly
- Consider counseling

**Consolidation without behavior change = wasted opportunity**

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Minimum payments trap you for decades:** $5,000 balance, 21% APR, 2% minimum = 32 years and $13,200 total paid

✓ **Fixed payments change everything:** Same $5,000 paying $200/month = 2.7 years and $6,000 total (saves $7,200!)

✓ **Avalanche saves most interest:** Attack highest rate first—mathematically optimal, can save thousands

✓  **Snowball provides motivation:** Attack smallest balance first—psychological wins help you stick with it

✓ **Balance transfers can save thousands:** $5,000 at 21% transferred to 0% for 18 months saves $1,100+ if paid off in time

✓ **Interest is calculated daily:** Compounds every single day—$5,000 at 21% accrues $2.88/day ($86/month)

✓ **Consolidation only works with discipline:** If you run up cards again after consolidating, you've doubled your problem

✓ **Every extra dollar matters:** Paying extra $50/month on $5,000 balance saves $1,000+ in interest and 5+ years

## Conclusion

Credit card debt keeps Americans trapped in 20-40 year repayment cycles when paying only minimums, costing 2-3x the original balance in interest. A $5,000 balance at 21% APR with 2% minimum payments takes 32 years to pay off and costs $13,202 total—but paying a fixed $200/month reduces payoff to 32 months and $6,008 total, saving $7,194 and 29 years.

The single most important decision is abandoning minimum payments: fix your payment at your current minimum (or higher) and never decrease it as the balance falls. This prevents the shrinking payment trap that keeps you in debt for decades.

For multiple credit cards, the debt avalanche method (targeting highest interest rate first) saves the most money—typically hundreds or thousands compared to the snowball method (targeting smallest balance first). However, if you need motivational wins to stay committed, snowball's early victories may be worth the small mathematical cost.

Balance transfers can save $1,000-3,000 on a $5,000-10,000 balance if used strategically: transfer to 0% APR promotional offer (typically 15-21 months), calculate required payment to pay off during promotion ($5,000 transferred to 18-month 0% requires $286/month), and avoid using the card for new purchases. But if you can't pay off during the promotion, you've just delayed the problem and paid a 3-5% transfer fee.

Debt consolidation loans work when rates are significantly lower (credit cards at 20%+ consolidated to personal loan at 10-12%) and you have the discipline to not run up card balances again—the #1 reason consolidation fails. Consolidating $10,000 in cards at 21% average to a 12% personal loan saves $4,000-7,000 depending on term.
